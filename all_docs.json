Mangalore Bishop Fr Aloysius Paul D’Souza said the Panel report had failed to ensure justice to Christians who were deeply hurt during the church attacks. “The Christian community is rejecting the report and demands a CBI probe in this regard,” he added. Urging the Commission to reveal names of people involved in the attacks, he said the protestors against the church attack were assaulted by police, youth were hunted and criminal cases were booked on them. The women, elderly persons and children were caned during the protests, but the Commission failed to understand the situation, he said, terming the Commission’s report as a bundle of contradictions. He urged the government to drop the cases registered against the Christians in connection with church attacks. BJP corporator Mariyamma Thomas said the Commission was appointed as part of a drama enacted by the state government. But justice has been denied, Mariyamma alleged. She said the community has been involved in conversion of people through education, health service, social work and helping the needy but not in the way what the Commission stated. A memorandum was submitted to the Deputy Commissioner of Police. Nearly 45 organisations from DK and Udupi districts supported the protest.

The lorry owners’ association was staging a protest by blocking the road near Ambedkar Circle. Suddenly, PSI Agni allegedly manhandled a lorry driver. When the his act was questioned by former zilla panchayat member Bashiruddin, Agni reportedly pointed his revolver at him. A verbal duel ensued between the two. However, timely intervention of senior police officers prevented any untoward incident. Bashiruddin told DySP Neelgar the police were cooperating with them all these days and asked why the PSI lost his patience on Thursday. “The PSI should be suspended for his rude behaviour,” Bashiruddin urged. Agni registered a counter-complaint against Bashiruddin and 40 others alleging that they disturbed him while on duty.

Unlike the attacks on SPI Cinemas and Woodlands Theatre the previous nights, not even stray incidents of violence were reported. Under a watchful police presence outside almost every one of the 445 screens it was released on, crowds flocked to catch shows from as early as 5 am. Most multiplexes cashed in and managed to wangle 6 shows, despite the movie’s run time of 2.46 hours. Propped up by holiday fanfare and a lot of hype generated by the controversy, the film opened to “overwhelming” collections for the producers. Though there were reports of the film raking in Rs 12.5 crore on release day in Tamil Nadu, which would put it past the earnings of Rajinikanth’s Endhiran in 2010 — these remained uncorroborated by producer K Karunamoorthy. Meanwhile, trade analysts used their machinations to estimate that the film has raked in an additional Rs 4 crore in Kerala and Karnataka and another `5 crore from overseas markets. While these remain to be individually ratified, distributors from the US, France and Malaysia tweeted that this has been a record breaking opening for a Tamil film. MM Cinemas, which has released Kaththi on 105 screens across the USA have posted that the premiere show alone raked in over $1,45,000. In the run-up to it’s release, Kaththi had been stalled by pro-Eelam groups who demanded that the producers name be removed. Only after Lyca Productions acceded to that were the decks cleared for the film’s release. However, Lyca’s CEO Subaskaran Allirajah was still listed as Producer in the ‘cut title’ version that released, but did not elicit any trouble from the protestors. Also, Gnanam, (a foundation run by Lyca) was used as a title card, in place of their logo.

His cannily choreographed rallies are the envy of many a corporate and political leader. NaMo has become a mantra, a mission and a model of governance. Offence is always his best defence. But he is on a course correction spree. Modi is not a Demosthenes of ideology anymore. He has chosen to pay back his rivals like RaGa (Rahul Gandhi) and NiKu (Nitish Kumar) in their own coin. The Congress and its apple polishers dubbed Modi’s weekend visit to Bihar martyrdom tourism, charging him with playing politics of grief. Modi visited the homes of all the six victims of the serial blasts which rocked Patna’s Gandhi Maidan and other parts of the city during his visit to address the Hunkar Rally on October 27. NaMo, who had avoided visiting the victims of the 2002 riots in his own state for a long time, lost no time in burning up aviation fuel by dashing to Patna twice in one week to express condolences and score points over his rambunctious rivals. These well-calculated demarches have rattled his detractors and hit them where it hurts the most-their political constituency. A close look at his recent manoeuvres reveals that NaMo, a staunch RSS faithful, is experiencing his Dale Carnegie moment-he has lifted virtual chapters from the Congress’ book of ‘How to Make Friends and Influence Enemies’ in order to establish himself as the new messiah of terror victims. Fishing in troubled waters has been the most effective and consistent virtue of all political leaders. For our avaricious politicians, agony is opportunity, and misery the canon of success. The last two weeks have witnessed scathing and scandalous scrimmages between NaMo and the supporters of both RaGa and NiKu. All have been extravagant with their arsenal in trying to lacerate and paralyse the opponent’s political moves. Both over half a dozen senior ministers of UPA and the Bihar Chief Minister challenged NaMo, accusing him of making factually incorrect statements against his adversaries and polarising voters in Bihar and other parts of the country. Now, he is charged with exploiting the grief of the terror victims of 26\/10. Modi’s strategy is crystal clear. Like any guerrilla operating in a treacherous political jungle, he has chosen to shoot and scoot. Even though he was caught making gaffes about Nehru avoiding Sardar Patel’s funeral, NaMo is determined to impose both his politics and political narrative on his rivals. His Bihar Mission has a method in its madness. With Lalu Prasad in jail, Modi launched verbal drone attacks against the weak NiKu government on the twin issues of security and governance. He has decided to demolish NiKu’s credibility by accusing him of patronising terror at the risk of serious threats to the lives of senior leaders and communal harmony in Bihar. By visiting the families of the Patna blast victims, NaMo is drilling home the point that NiKu is least bothered about the personal tragedies of his people. So incensed was the Bihar chief minister with NaMo’s missiles that he retorted by unleashing a personal attack on his oppugner. Ridiculing NaMo’s frequent visits, NiKu termed his foe an outsider and claimed that the people of Bihar are “buying brooms during Deepawali to clean the garbage that has come to Bihar”. It’s History Redux in the politically fertile land of Bihar. NaMo seems to have carefully imbibed that chapter of political history which changed Indian politics. It was in Bihar that Indira Gandhi launched her retaliatory charge against the Janata government in 1978. In August that year, militantly aggressive Kurmis mowed down 14 Dalits in the sleepy hamlet of Belchchi in Nalanda district. Only a year ago, Indira had lost power. But she lost no time in taking advantage of the bloody caste war that ensued. Karpoori Thakur, a socialist but a weak administrator, was the state’s chief minister. Indira landed in Nalanda and waded into the floodwaters on an elephant to visit each Dalit family, which had lost members in the caste pogrom. On her return to Patna, she called on the ailing Jayaprakash Narayan who was responsible for her crushing electoral ignominy. JP expressed his distress over the non-performing state government. He told Indira, “Indu, I wish you a better future, brighter than your past.” Her Nalanda visit revived the Congress, and the party won its first by-election in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh three months later—Mohsina Kidwai, the Congress candidate, won the Azamgarh Lok Sabha constituency, the first seat won by the party in north India after its 1977 rout. If a collapsed colossus like Indira could manage a triumphant return to power using raging caste violence, a NaMo with an equally charismatic personality and supported by a committed cadre could use the same political thesaurus. In his campaign, Modi is only using the well-tested techniques adopted by Congress leaders in the recent past. His research team has compiled a long list of grief and poverty tours undertaken by top Congress leaders. Last year, Rahul Gandhi made a motorbike trip to bond with Bhattaparsol, where the Uttar Pradesh Police allegedly tortured farmers. The grief list also includes the nights spent by Rahul in Dalit colonies and the visits of Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi to Chhattisgarh after top Congress leaders were massacred by Naxalites. Modiites are now reminding the Congress about the trips which Sonia and the Prime Minister made to Muzzafarnagar after 43 were killed in the worst-ever communal clashes in decades. If the Congress is accusing NaMo of marketing grief for electoral gains, the BJP has charged it with selling poverty to retain power. The tendency to encash on human tragedies for electoral gains is becoming an acceptable norm for taking a gullible voter for a ride. The Battle of 2014 is fought on the landscapes of the mistakes and miseries of the past and not on how to draw a new roadmap for the future. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/prabhu-chawla\/pc-columns\/2013\/nov\/03\/Modi-takes-a-leaf-out-of-Congress-book-plays-politics-of-grief-on-enemy-turf-533278.html"}

Sangram broke his 11-day fast and was shifted to District Headquarters Hospital at Paralakhemundi minutes after two OJM office-bearers carried the letter to him. Amiya Pandav and Santosh Mohapatra, the OJM office-bearers, tried to meet Sangram but were not allowed. The letter was sent to Sangram through his lawyer. In the letter, which was written on an OJM letterhead, Pyari lauded Sangram’s non-violent agitation against injustice but asked him to refrain from the strike anymore since his services would be required for the people as well as for his outfit of which the latter is a member. Sangram was arrested with firearms and other supplies on December 5 on the charges of links with Maoists by police in Gajapati and lodged in R Udaygiri jail. He had been on hunger strike since then. After he was persuaded by jail officials, Sangram has been taking glucose water twice a day, but refused any food. As his health deteriorated, jail authorities had arranged for doctors in the jail to treat him in case of any emergency. The end to hunger strike came as a relief to the jail administration. The treating doctors said Sangram lost around 5 kg due to the hunger strike. Dr Amulya Misra of the district headquarters hospital at Paralakhemundi had referred him to MKCG MCH or SCB MCH but in the absence of required escort, he could not be shifted, said jail sources. Amid tight security arrangements, Sangram was shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital. Meanwhile, the Gajapati District and Sessions Court has fixed the hearing of Sangram’s bail plea on December 20. After the arrest, his bail plea was filed at R Udayagiri Court and the SDJM had rejected it. On Friday, the family members of Sangram Mohanty filed a bail petition before the Gajapati district judge but it could not be considered and the hearing was postponed. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/odisha\/2012\/dec\/17\/sangram-ends-fast-at-pyaris-request-434624.html"}

There is no precedent for such unwarranted largesse in the aftermath of an agitation. Whether it is the recent demonstrations against a nuclear power plant in Jaitapur in Maharashtra or the earlier outbreaks in Singur and Nandigram in West Bengal, the matter of relief and rehabilitation was left to the state governments according to a well-established practice. A sudden deviation from it carries ominous implications, not least because the scale of the outbreak in the UP village was not large enough to warrant such a departure from the norm. If the centre has nevertheless chosen to violate it, the reason has less to do with a sudden outpouring of sympathy for those who have been at the receiving end of police highhandedness than with advancing the Congress’s electoral prospects in the area and among the affected agrarian communities. Ever since the party’s crown prince jumped into the fray to the state government’s discomfiture, it had been obvious that he intended to use the incident as a launching pad for the Congress’ campaign for next year’s assembly elections. Hence, his representations to the prime minister and the subsequent prompt announcement of the official bounty. Unfortunately, however, the resultant distortion in official outlook in accordance with the whims and fancies of one particular general secretary of the party carries disturbing portents for the federal structure. Rahul Gandhi’s elevation to a position which is seemingly one step below the president’s may be of concern only for the party, but the tweaking of government’s policies entails the possibility of an unseemly clamour for succour after every agitation irrespective of whether it is about land, as in Bhatta-Parsaul, or a communal or caste conflict or a trade union dispute. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/opinions\/editorials\/2011\/may\/23\/leave-relief-and-rehab-to-state-governments-255797.html"}

The month-long plan entails four weeks of escalating activity on the issue. In the first week, the demonstrating students would focus on boycotting Sri Lanka. This would involve demands to shut down the Deputy High Commission in Chennai and imposition of economic sanctions, among other. The second week would see demonstrations demanding that special refugee camps run by the Tamil Nadu government in Chengalpattu and Poonamallee be shut down. Students claim these camps have become special torture camps. The third week would see students taking out protests and demonstrations in partnership with the fishing community, against repeated attacks on Tamil Nadu’s fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy. This phase would see the see students put forth the creation of a Tamil Eelam as the only solution to the attacks on the fishermen. The fourth week would see public meetings and demonstrations against the “Centre’s anti-Tamil activities”. Addressing reporters on Friday, representatives of the committee stressed on the non-political nature of their collective, but conceded to the fact that individuals may have political affiliations. They also rubbished suggestions that the student protests were losing steam, saying the lower turnout in recent weeks was due to examinations. The students of the committee, which has so far lacked a leadership or a chain of command, said they are working on a district-level organisation structure. They also fended off repeated questions on their activities resembling those of political parties, even as a student declared, “There is a need for the students’ struggle to become a people’s movement.” They also said they had the support of students from Jaffna University. The students said they had conversations with Lankan Tamils living in Vanni, and claimed they had been told that torture by armed forces was on the decline. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/cities\/chennai\/2013\/apr\/13\/month-long-escalating-protests-to-mark-4th-anniversary-of-mullivaikkal-pogrom-467485.html"}

Unfortunately, an attempt by the CITU-affiliated employees’ association to invite the attention of the public into the issue has courted a fresh controversy with the management jumping into action against the ‘gross indiscipline’ leaving the original issue unattended. The controversy sparked off after the Kerala State Road Transport Employees Association (KSRTEA) pasted stickers on KSRTC buses seeking public intervention against ‘police-goonda’ attack on employees. The management responded to this by issuing an order the other day seeking immediate removal of the posters. ‘’The sticker portray the police in bad light and is in violation of the rules,’’ said K M Irshad, executive director of the Corporation, who issued the order. ‘’We have directed all station officers to ensure that the stickers are removed by Friday night,’’ he said.

The hartal was observed as part of the protest against the government decision to widen National Highways in the state with 45-meter width and also hike the toll rate at Varapuzha brige at National Highway 17. It was a peaceful hartal and no violence was reported. Schools and educational institutions remained closed. Both private and KSRTC buses kept off the roads as protestors had requested them not to ply in the Varapuzha route. Private vehicles were not seen on the roads after protestors had asked all motorists to take diversion through Edappally. Shops in the area were also shut down. According to protestors, though several people had surrendered their land for 30-meter wide National Highway decades ago, the land still remains unused. “In most areas of the National Highway 17 in Paravoor, Varapuzha and Vadakekkara, 30 meters of land has been taken from the residents. Some of the people have started encroaching the land taken for the widening project and the government has not taken action,” a Samara Samiti member said. After the National Highway took over the NH-17, the toll of the Varapuzha bridge has increased five-fold. The rate for cars for a one-way trip through the bridge increased from `5 to `25. For a two-way trip, car drivers would have to pay `40 compared to the earlier rate of `7.50.

The unruly mob turned violent and set two police jeeps, a mini-bus, four two-wheelers and a TASMAC outlet on fire. The windshields of several government and private buses and an ambulance were damaged in the stone-pelting incident. Some protestors also ransacked two private hospitals in the vicinity and attacked the Ambur Town Station. Police lathi-charged the protestors at about at about 10 PM. The protestors, however, split up into small groups and hid themselves on top of some houses in Nellikollai, Housing Board and Pudumannai areas and pelted stones indiscriminately at policemen. After reinforcements arrived, police personnel entered Nellikollai and the other areas and brought the situation under control. Police have arrested as many as 181 persons since the protests began and were taken to an undisclosed place for inquiry and released 86 persons, all under 18 years of age. The Ambur Town Police registered seven cases against the remaining 105 persons under sections 147, 148, 294 (b), 506 (ii), 353, 324 and 307 of Indian Penal Code.

The body of Ahmed was brought from the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in an ambulance reaching Ambur at about 2 am. Around 50 women protested and tried to surround the Tahsildar office in Ambur Town demanding the release of the persons arrested, claiming the persons arrested were innocents. They withdrew the protest after the revenue and police officials assured them that they would release the persons not involved in the clash. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/tamil-nadu\/2015\/jun\/29\/95-Youth-Arrested-for-Attack-on-Ambur-cops-776259.html"}

MUMBAI: The protest by NGO ‘Swabhiman’ led by Maharashtra Industry Minister Narayan Rane’s son Nitesh Rane against 15 percent water supply cut by the Shiv Sena-ruled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) claimed one life on Thursday. Later, Nitesh was arrested by the police. Vishal Dholakia, 43, one among the few hundred protesters, allegedly died of head injuries at the G T Hospital in south Mumbai (situated close to the police headquarters), though the authorities attributed his death to a heart attack. Earlier, under the aegis of Swabhiman, hundreds of people tried to barge into the BMC headquarters near the CST. The police foiled the move by resorting to lathicharge and many got hurt in the melee. ACP R K Padmanabhan said, “Dholakia apparently had some medical condition and died of an attack.” According to the hospital authorities, Dholakia did not have any injury marks on his body. The BMC resorted to a cut in water supply by 15 percent - citing poor rainfall during this monsoon. Nitesh Rane, who was later granted bail, said that his NGO would not allow the mayor and civic commissioner to move around the city without withdrawing the water supply cut. The new development led by Narayan Rane’s son assumed significance as this came barely two days after Rane’s attempt to usurp power in BMC (from the Shiv Sena) became dab squib as the Sena’s woman mayoral candidate won hands down in the polls. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/nation\/2009\/dec\/04\/violence-over-cut-in-water-supply-109873.html"}

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh strongly condemned the attack, describing it as most unfortunate and cowardly act of Maoists. A tribal leader from Bastar, Mahendra is on the hit list of naxals for strongly advocating Salwa Judum (Civil Vigilante group) and raising an armed tribal group to fight ultras. A state official said that considering the high level of threat, Mahendra was provided with ‘Z plus’ security. “His convoy, comprising seven similar looking vehicles, was on the way to Basrur where Karma was supposed to attend a party meeting. Ultras had accurate intelligence input regarding his SUV and IED was triggered targeting his vehicle only. After the blast, Maoists opened indiscriminate firing. His driver and two commandos travelling in the SUV sustained minor injuries and were rushed to Dantewada for medical examination,” the official said. Mahendra and his family members have been repeatedly targeted by ultras. He himself survived over a dozen attacks in the last seven years. In 2005, approximately 200 armed naxals killed Suku Karma, brother of Mahendra, in Dantewada. In another attack in 2009, ultra’s quick action group killed Cahnnu Karma, his close relative. Though the controversial group was disbanded by the Supreme Court in 2011, Karma remained a target of Naxal groups.

But while the US would encourage India and Pakistan, problems between the countries can be \"solved by the two countries themselves having that kind of ongoing dialogue,\" she said in an interview with Pakistan's Samaa TV last week, according to a transcript released by the State Department. Asked about Pakistan's perceived concerns about India's engagement in Afghanistan and its alleged support to militants in Balochistan province, Clinton said it was in the interest of both countries to address all issues in an open way. \"Well, we think, very strongly, that it is in both Pakistan's and India's interest to get back to a dialogue and to try to address every one of these issues in an open way. It is not in India's interest for Pakistan to be destabilised,\" she said and \"It is not in Pakistan's interest for Afghanistan to be destabilised.\" \"This neighbourhood is now at risk because of the presence of terrorists who wish to destabilise India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan,\" Clinton said suggesting that Pakistan based terrorist outfit Lashkar-e-Taeba had staged the 26\/11 Mumbai terrorist attacks to provoke war between the two neighbours. \"So the historical issues that, certainly are very significant between India and Pakistan, have to be addressed by the two countries, because otherwise you will think the worst of each other, and terrorists will try to create war between India and Pakistan, because that would further their gain as they did with Mumbai,\" she said. Asked if the US will encourage Pakistan and India to solve some of the old problems, like Kashmir, Clinton said: \"Yes, absolutely.\" But \"We know that no one on the outside can solve these problems. It can only be solved by the two countries themselves having that kind of ongoing dialogue.\" \"So we've encouraged both Pakistan and India to resume that dialogue and to talk about everything, including Kashmir, because now the security of both countries is threatened by these forces of extremism.\" \"And I believe that a lot of these terrorist groups are funded, directed, equipped, and trained by outside forces, not people from Pakistan, not people from India, but people who wish to see the two countries at - in conflict, and I think that is so critical to avoid. And the only way to avoid it is by getting back into a dialogue,\" Clinton said. In another interview with Watandost.com, she said an international effort by US, China and European Union could at best be a guarantor but an impetus for a dialogue must come from the two countries themselves. \"I think it could be a guarantor or it could be a positive force for implementation. \"But I think that the impetus must come from the two countries themselves,\" she said. \"And at some point, both countries might say we've gotten as far as we can get; therefore we need some support, we need some new energy.

The driving manual has a darker subtext: the end justifies the meanness. JD(U)’s caliph Nitish Kumar has denied his pet hate Narendra Modi a bulletproof SUV for his Hunkar Rally at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on October 27. Nitish decided to use the two bulletproof SUVs available with the government for himself, to attend a ‘chintan shivir’ outside Patna on October 28 and 29. Modi was offered a bulletproof Ambassador instead. These retrofitted cars are inferior to factory-made SUVs as security vehicles. Given Nitish’s facile attempts to create roadblocks for the high-speed Modi pollwagon, will the Ambassador develop engine trouble? Desperation drives even the smartest of men to tamper with political brakes, and Nitish Kumar is a desperate man. Modi is Nitish’s relentless nightmare. There is nothing more humiliating for a leader to be downsized on his turf. During the previous elections, the BJP invited Modi to Bihar to boost the poll campaign. Nitish blocked it. As time passed and he increasingly became nationally irrelevant, Modi’s rise was the main threat to him being PM. His paranoia reached comic extremes. First, he gave permission for only a part of Gandhi Maidan to be used for Modi’s rally. He then invited President Pranab Mukherjee to visit on the dates Modi would be in the city—26 and 27. Patna was to be barricaded and Modi’s plane was not to be allowed to land until the President’s aircraft took off. Mukherjee wisely refused to be drawn into Nitish’s churlish stratagems. As the date of the Hunkar Rally grew nearer, and the expected attendance count grew to over two lakh—greater than any Adhikar Rally of Nitish’s—the JD(U) began to panic. Modi posters were pulled down on streets. Party Vice-President Ram Kishore Singh threatened to “put him (Modi) behind bars”, because following the Muzaffarnagar riots, the state government had received IB alerts on possible communal unrest. It is surprising that Nitish should suddenly take these alerts seriously after ignoring the torrent of intelligence that had been pouring into Patna on the Darbhanga terror factory. Bihar, under Nitish Kumar, has been a fertile breeding ground for terror. In May 2012, when the Karnataka Police arrested Kafeel Akthar from Darbhanga for his alleged role in the Chinnaswamy Stadium attacks in 2010, Nitish raged that it was illegal. The Bihar terror connection became even more obvious in August 2013 after the NIA picked up Yasin Bhatkal, one of India’s 12 most wanted terrorists, from Raxaul, Bihar. He was behind the bomb blasts of Pune, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Mumbai. He had trained aspiring terrorists who joined his creation, the ‘Darbhanga module’—an Indian Mujahedeen outfit bred in Bihar. Nitish chose to stay schtum and reportedly asked his state police to curb its enthusiasm over the arrest. Nitish’s criticism of Islamic terror was typically muted after the Bodh Gaya blasts, which his police showed little interest in investigating. Is the leadership that named Ishrat Jahan as the beti of Bihar unaware of the fact that Modi is the most prized target of Islamic terror groups? Nitish hopes that by going slow on terror, he would remain the minority darling. Like Rahul Gandhi’s famous “ISI wooing Muzaffarnagar youth” statement, does Nitish too think Indian Muslims are unpatriotic? In politics, bandwagons matter more than bulletproof SUVs. Many political drivers have left behind malignant legacies. In January 1990, VP Singh as Prime Minister withdrew SPG cover for Rajiv Gandhi who was on the hit list of terrorists. It was payback for the humiliation Singh had received at his former boss’s hands. It would be foolish to compare VP Singh or Nitish Kumar with an iconic statesman like Atal Bihari Vajpayee who made the security of Rajiv Gandhi’s children and widow a matter of grave importance. A lesson Nitish still can learn is that reputations are not bulletproof. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/opinions\/columns\/ravi-shankar\/2013\/oct\/27\/Roadblock-politics-530657.html"}

At the same tine, he sent out a warning to the ruling party that if the Lokpal Bill was not passed in the Winter session he will work against Congress in the coming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and four other states like in Hisar. In an interview to 'Aaj Tak' before going on 'Maun Vrat', the 74-year-old Gandhian said after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's latest letter to him, he was encouraged that the government would bring a strong Lokpal, the channel said in a release. \"If the government brings a strong Lokpal and keeps its other promises, why should I oppose the Congress. In fact we will work with the Congress,\" he said, referring to the Lokpal Bill and to electoral reforms including right to reject, decentralisation and more powers to gram sabhas. Seeking to dispel the notion that Team Anna is anti-Congress, he denied that they had campaigned against Congress in Hisar at the behest of BJP and RSS. \"I have only seen him (RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat) on TV, I have never met him or spoken to him. These are all allegations. In politics political parties are ready to do anything. The Congress, BJP and RSS are together conspiring to defame Anna. I have nothing to do with the RSS or BJP,\" Hazare said. In his October 10 letter to Hazare, the Prime Minister had declared government's commitment to a strong Lokpal while saying that his demand for 'Right to Reject' provision in electoral law needs political consensus. Hazare made light of Congress leader Digvijay Singh's claim that he was being set up as a Presidential candidate in 2012. \"I neither have the aptitude nor the desire to become President. In any case, if I become President I won't be able to do what I have been doing for society now.\" He said the Congress and BJP were shooting in the dark by spreading such rumours. Hazare denied that that he had received any letter from the RSS. \"I don't even recognise Ram Madhav,\" he said when asked why the RSS leader was allowed on stage during the Jantar Mantar agitation. He said he had never thanked BJP President Nitin Gadkari for the BJP's support. \"If someone else from my team did, I can't say.\" In a rebuff to Team Anna member Prashant Bhushan, Hazare said he has completely disassociated himself with his remarks on Kashmir. \"I am against anybody who talks about dividing the country.

The party leadership in Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, called for statewide bandh on Monday to condemn what it called a “concerted attack on Hindu leaders in the state.” Ramesh, the state BJP unit’s general secretary and a charted accountant by profession, was murdered by assailants in Salem while he was on his way back home after visiting the party office on Friday evening. “I am shocked to hear about the brutal killing of Shri V Ramesh our General Secretary of Tamil Nadu unit. This is the third assassination of a Tamil Nadu BJP leader in a sequence. We demand a thorough probe in to these killings,” tweeted Swaraj. The same emotion was echoed by Modi. “My deepest condolences to the family of Shri V Ramesh. May his soul rest in peace. The culprits must be punished at the earliest,” his tweet read. A statement issued by BJP Nirmala Seetharaman said Ramesh had served the BJP since 1991. Listing a number of such killings of and attacks on BJP leaders in the past one year, she said the incidents seemed to be “targeted.” The release also pointed to the attempted attack on senior BJP leader L K Advani during his visit to Madurai in 2011. While the pipe bomb planted near Alampatti was fortunately detected in time, Seetharaman said not all accused in the case have been arrested, with at least two people as yet absconding. “It is apparent that all these attacks are undertaken with detailed planning and after surveillance of the movements of these activists. Each of these attacks has been gruesome and brutal. These attacks and killings may be aimed at instilling fear in the minds of the people in general and of our party workers in particular,” the statement read and demanded a Special Investigation Team to go into each of the incidents. Anguished by the murder of Ramesh, hundreds of BJP workers staged a protest at near the Valluvar Kottam in Chennai on Saturday. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu BJP president Pon Radhakrishnan said the party has called for a statewide bandh on Monday to condemn the murder. Speaking to reporters, he said in the last one year, three state-level leaders—Aravinth Reddy, Murugan and Vellaiyan—have been murdered and the assailants were still at large. This was apart from a number of leaders from other Hindu organisations who have been targeted. On July 8, Kuttinambi, a secretary of the Rameswaram unit of the Hindu Munnani, was found murdered with head injuries sparking tension in the area. This incident came close in the heels of the killing of Vellaiyan, the state secretary of Hindu Munnani, in Vellore. A number of state BJP leaders have also been targets over the past one year. This included Murugan, a BJP activist and former municipal councillor in Ramanathapuram, Aravinth Reddy, secretary of the BJP medical cell in Vellore, and Pugazhenthi, state general council member in Nagapattinam. Chennai also saw such an incident when Vital, a ward secretary of the party, was found dead in Koyambedu in April 2012. Meanwhile, the Salem Range DIG, Sanjay Kumar, said that a special team has been formed to nab the assailants who murdered Ramesh. The incident was condemned by leaders across political parties including by Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president B S Gnanadesikan and PMK leader S Ramadoss. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/thesundaystandard\/2013\/jul\/21\/TN-BJP-man-felled-leaders-call-for-arrests-498870.html"}

Some locals gheraoed the policemen, when they were in the village for investigation, demanding immediate arrest of the culprits. Gamango was known to be fighting for the rights of the tribal people, particularly for proper implementation of the Forest Rights Act. The tribal leader was removed from his post in the Lok Sangram Manch about one-and-a-half-year ago for alleged indiscipline. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/odisha\/2016\/may\/23\/Tribal-leader-Edunga-Gamamgo-found-murdered-in-Odisha-907081.html"}

A two-member bench, which perhaps for the first time in legal history conducting in-camera proceedings in a contempt case, had to be shielded with iron barricades and hundreds of men in khaki. Outside the court hall were nearly 100 advocates shouting slogans and hurling abuses against the judiciary and a few judicial officers. At the centre of all the noise is the suo motu contempt proceedings initiated by a bench of the High Court against two Madurai-based Bar functionaries. The much-anticipated trouble began in the morning when a group of advocates, who assembled near the Aavin entrance of the High Court campus, staged a protest and attempted to block the NSC Bose Road. But, they were dispersed by the police. When the contempt case hearing began around 2.15 pm, hundreds of lawyers tried to enter court hall no 4, but were stopped by the police. “Public faith in the judiciary is because of the open hearings and transparent nature of the court. In camera proceedings should be conducted only in exception cases like those relating to terrorism,” said legal veteran NGR Prasad, refusing to enter the court in these circumstances. He was scheduled to appear for one of the contemnors, A K Ramasamy, general secretary of Madurai Bar Association. Soon, the huge posse of advocates started raising defamatory slogans against a few judges. During the proceedings, the bench, consisting of S Tamilvanan and C T Selvam, posed a series of tough questions to A K Ramasamy. The court dispensed with the presence of another contemnor, Dharmaraj, president of the association, based on the submission by his counsel Paul Kanagaraj. “Have you been adjudged insolvent, as per the order, dated 30.10.2006 made in I.P No 71 of 2002 on the file of the learned III Additional sub-court Madurai?” This was one of the questions posed by the judges for which, like for most questions, Ramasamy said he must refer documents and consult his counsel before giving an answer. But the court itself offered the documents relating to the insolvency of Ramasamy. It ordered issuance of notices to the Bar Council of India and the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, along with the copies of the insolvency papers of Ramasamy. “They are required to state if the fact of second contemnor having been declared insolvent has been brought to their notice, either by the contemnor or others, whether his name has been struck off the electoral roll, whether the contemnor has participated in elections after his having been declared insolvent,” the order directed the two Bar councils. Noting that all the answers by Dharmaraj as improper and evasive, in the interest of justice, a copy of the questionnaire was furnished to the second contemnor. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/cities\/chennai\/2015\/sep\/17\/Contempt-Hearing-Amid-Siege-816064.html"}
{"url":"http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/opinions\/2010\/apr\/15\/blatant-efforts-to-wage-a-proxy-war-146180.html","text":"Blatant efforts to wage a proxy war 15th April 2010 12:33 AM The Dantewada massacre took the lives of 76 CRPF jawans and caused a huge setback to the Union home ministry’s self-proclaimed ‘war on tribal terror’. It also portends a debilitating civil war unless humane governance replaces the gun-wielding ‘area-domination’ mindset in the heartland. Instead all we get is sound-bytes. Union home minister P Chidambaram says something must have gone “drastically wrong” and orders an inquiry. Before finding out what went wrong, he discreetly suggests the use of air power against the Maoists: “At present there is no mandate to use the Air Force or any aircraft. But, if necessary, we will have to revisit the mandate to make some changes.” But the Air Force chief says: “Our training and weapons are meant for enemies across the border and to inflict maximum lethality. We cannot do this on our own people.” The army chief too says it is not wise to deploy the army against Naxalites. Defence minister A K Antony rules out direct deployment of armed forces. Pushed on the back foot, Chidambaram offers to resign, which as expected is rejected by the prime minister. The BJP spokesperson says Chidambaram has been entrusted with the nation’s security and the responsibility is his. They want him to ‘face boldly the situation which has arisen.’ Their ally and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is more to the point. He wants Chidambaram to work more and speak less and control his ‘tone and tenor’. As for Chidambaram, if the Maoists believe in shooting their way to revolutionary glory, he seems to believe he can rein them in by shooting off his mouth and jumping the gun with his thoughtless rhetoric. When he visited Lalgarh on April 4, everyone expected a series of confidence-boosting measures. But he tried to pass the buck to the state government. For good measure, he added that the Maoists were “cowards hiding in jungles” and fixed a three-year timeframe for their elimination. The Maoists hit back with a vengeance within 48 hours, butchering 76 security personnel. A rattled Chidambaram hurriedly termed the Maoists ‘savage’ as if the whole issued hinged on the adjectives he chose. He did not even spare army chief general V K Singh who had said in good faith that the massacre was perhaps due to inadequate training and orientation. One need not be a top-notch commando, as the general was in his younger days, to say this. Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of jungle warfare would say this a thousand times. Why is the ‘calm, composed and competent’ darling of India’s neo-liberal media getting so worked up when it comes to tribals and unwashed Naxal-Maoists? Why does he brand well-meaning intellectuals and ideologues as Naxalite-extremists? Why have things gone so far as to make social activists lament that ‘in this country whoever tries to fight for justice, who talks about the poor, who brings up the issue of human rights, the government labels all of them as Naxal supporters’. The answer lies in the mandate of Operation Green Hunt — to clear the tribal area of insurgent groups, hold the territory to ensure that Maoists can’t re-enter, and, finally, prepare the ground for development projects by ‘civilian agencies’. This is not a mandate for a counter-insurgency mission in the jungles where paramilitary forces are expected to ‘fight guerrillas like a guerrilla’ and not capture or hold territory. Then for whom is this mandate intended? Obviously for the mining-MNCs who can build their industrial empires on this ‘captured’ territory. A look at the interests of the London-based MNC — Vedanta Resources plc, one of the world’s largest — gives enough clues. Of India’s total aluminium capacity of 1.3 million tonnes, Vedanta’s share is 3,85,000 tonnes. Its 5,00,000-tonne smelter in Orissa’s Jharsuguda is getting commissioned and the company will ultimately create 1.6 million tonnes of smelting capacity there, to be backed by a five million-tonne alumina refinery at Lanjigarh and a power complex of 3,750 MW. Its subsidiary, Balco’s capacity will be raised to one million tonnes. In Lanjigarh alone Vedanta has access to bauxite deposits of 75 million tonnes and the government has promised an equally large deposit nearby. A five million tonne refinery is justified provided links to bauxite deposits lasting for about 50 years can be acquired. Orissa, where most of Vedanta’s aluminium action is to unfold, has an estimated 1.7 billion tonnes of the country’s total 3.3 billion tonnes of reserves. Vedanta says it has strong claims to free deposits because of the world’s single largest smelter it is committed to building at Jharsuguda. If Vedanta has its way all this capacity will be on the ground by 2013. These reserves lie under the tribal forestland. It all depends whether Chidambaram can secure and deliver this land, a task he has taken upon himself and for the purpose declared a state-of-war. The fact that Chidambaram had a close relationship with Vedanta raises serious concerns about the motive, agenda and mandate of this ‘war on tribal terror’. In 2003, he represented Sterlite Industries (a group company) before the Bombay High Court, when it faced charges of avoiding customs duties and tax evasion. Shortly afterwards, Chidambaram became a director on the board of Vedanta and only surrendered this job on May 22, 2004 — a day before taking up the position of finance minister at the Centre. With an orchestrated neo-liberal media baying for ‘full-scale war’, area-domination operations have restarted. This time around it is the commandos of the Special Action Force who have been specially trained to fight Naxals. And the tribals are fleeing their villages. The question is: With such a blatant and high-level ‘conflict of interest’ does the home ministry have any moral authority to pursue this proxy-war? url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/opinions\/2010\/apr\/15\/blatant-efforts-to-wage-a-proxy-war-146180.html"}

Hundreds of locals on Monday blocked NH 55 for six hours demanding scraping of the MoU. The slogan, “We want Sureswari irrigation project not JR Power Plant” rented the air even as vehicular traffic came to a standstill from 6 am till noon following the blockade by people of Kishorenagar area. The locals have been raising the issue for the past few months. The State Government had entered into an agreement for setting up 2,000 MW power project here in 2007. They had earlier staged agitations at Kishorenagar and Angul. The protestors accused the Government of reneging on its commitment when the Chief Minister had himself announced, during an election rally, allocation of funds for the proposed Sureswari irrigation project here. The stir was led by Ramani Ranjan Padhan under the banner of Jivan Jibika Surakhya Samiti. The blockade was lifted following an assurance from ADM Debraj Senapati and the additional SP J.

Meanwhile, a fresh controversy has been erupted. There are allegations that though Health Minister V S Sivakumar had taken a favourable decision in response to the demands of the students, some higher officials in the Health Department, sabotaged it. The allegations got strong back-up when the Kerala Medicos Joint Action Council (KMJAC), which spearheaded the previous strike, also raised the same concern. The students are dissatisfied with the delay in reaching a decision over various demands raised by the KMJAC. Banking up on the Health Minister’s assurance, the students, who were on the warpath against the CRS and bond system retracted from the agitations on April 23, 2012. “We held discussions with the minister several times. However, no decision, including revoking of separate CRS for MBBS, post graduation and senior residency, has been implemented yet,” they said. “On the contrary, Director of Medical Education (DME) has come up with another order. According to it, fresh PG students who did not sign bond contract for CRS will not get stipend. This is against the assurance of the minister,” said Dr P S Jinesh, convener of KMJAC. According to the order issued on July 25, the first year PG students, who did not sign bond contract, have been denied stipend for July. The KMJAC office-bearers approached the Health Minister demanding withdrawal of this order. “However, the officials concerned refused to revoke the order though the minister had given a verbal order to the DME,” they said. DME V Geetha told Express that the order has been revoked following the health secretary issuing a written order on August 13. “According to the existing rules, bond should be executed before the first stipend is being disbursed. However, we got written order by Tuesday and we have already revoked the decision to block the stipend for those who have not signed bond. We cannot do anything without a written directive,” Dr Geetha said. Meanwhile, the minister said that issues would be resolved in a couple of days. “I have discussed the issues with medical students and the officials concerned. The final decision will be taken in a couple of days.

They said mediation would be the best option to resolve such a sensitive matter that may initiate another round of legal war if taken to the Supreme Court. Ansari Sunday met Mahant Gyan Das, who wields considerable influence not only in Ayodhya but also among top Hindu priests, and urged him to jointly work out an amicable settlement of the Ayodhya issue. \"His (Ansari's) move is really praiseworthy…We must acknowledge that no religion is above humanity…In my opinion, the step taken by Ansari is just for humanity and not for any religion,\" Maulana Yasoob Abbas, the spokesperson of the All India Shia Personal Law Board, told IANS Monday on telephone. \"I am sure that if the dispute is resolved amicably, it will strengthen the relations of Hindus and Muslims and will spread a message of communal harmony and peace across the globe,\" he added. Echoing similar views, head priest of Ayodhya's Ram Lalla temple Mahant Acharya Satyendra Das said: \"It was really heartening to hear that Hashim Ansari met Gyan Das to jointly work out an amicable agreement.\" \"I wish now Nirmohi Akhada (one of the three parties in the Ayodhya title dispute) also responds to Ansari in a positive way,\" Das told IANS on telephone from Ayodhya, some 150 km from Lucknow. \"We should not forget the judgment on the Ayodhya issue came after more than 60 years…And you will agree that there's still a sense of uncertainty pertaining to the settlement of the case as some parties are reportedly gearing up to move the Supreme Court,\" Das said. \"Taking this into account, it seems an amicable settlement would be the most viable option to resolve the dispute and end the uncertainty once and for all,\" Das said. Expressing similar sentiments, chairperson of the All India Muslim Women's Personal Law Board Shaista Amber, told IANS: \"As the (Ayodhya) issue has already taken a political colour, it would be really great if the matter is resolved through talks and discussions.\" \"I welcome the step taken by Hashim Ansari and feel that an amicable settlement of the issue will be a slap on faces of those who want to keep it alive for vested interest,\" Amber said. Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahli, a prominent Sunni cleric who heads Lucknow's oldest Islamic seminary, said: \"The move by Hashim Ansari is a good one.\" \"Considering the sensitive nature of the case, amicable settlement remains a better option…I personally feel that there's no issue that cannot be solved through talks and discussions,\" he said. Mahant Jugal Kishore Shastri, a priest with the Ayodhya-based Saryu Kunj temple, said: \"At this stage, if other religious leaders from different parts of the country also come forward and join hands to work out an amicable settlement of the Ayodhya issue, I personally feel that the Ansari's move would definitely produce the desirable result.\" A special three-judge bench of the Allahabad High Court's Lucknow bench Thursday by a majority verdict ruled that the place where the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya stood, before it was razed by Hindu mobs in 1992, was indeed the birthplace of Hindu god Ram. It also ruled that the entire disputed land in Ayodhya, a riverside temple town in Uttar Pradesh, should be divided among the Sunni Central Waqf Board, the Ram temple and the Nirmohi Akhara, a Hindu sect, that were among those who fought the court battle. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/nation\/2010\/oct\/04\/ayodhya-litigant-for-out-of-court-settlement-192410.html"}

He was, virtually, assigned a status akin to that of the Dark Lord for having slept through the demolition of the Babri mosque and the decimation of the Congress’ minority vote-bank, thereafter. But the Liberhan Commission could change it all. Armed with the clean-chit from the inquiry panel report tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, the Congress is tentatively defending former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao. “His hands were tied by the Constitution. Article 355 is not actionable. It does not allow the Centre to intervene in the state’s affairs and, in the absence of a Governor’s report, there could be no Article 356 (imposed),’’ said senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee in defence of Rao’s inaction in the Ayodhya-Babri episode. However, this does not necessarily mean that the Congress would air-brush Rao’s image or give him a place of honour along with the other Prime Ministers of the party. In the Congress’ hall of fame, Rao’s photos have no place. Even his body was not allowed inside the AICC building. If in death he was placed outside the gates of AICC, in the last years of life he was treated as a pariah for having failed to protect the party’s image on December 6, 1992. Then Congress president Sitaram Kesari was famously quoted as saying in a press conference: “No, no, no to Narasimha. I’ve ‘cut’ his ticket. He failed to protect the Babri Masjid.’’ If it was meant for wooing the minority vote back in the 1998 elections, Kesari failed miserably and lost his own job by March. As for Rao’s rehabilitation, the Congress is now grappling with its own past. The party had squarely blamed Rao, whom the Commission has given a clean chit. Not so long ago, Rahul Gandhi created quite a stir when he said, quoting his mother Sonia Gandhi, that the Babri Masjid would never have fallen had a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family been at the helm of power. Warning the people to be vary of both the Congress party and the Bharatiya Janata Party, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati on Wednesday accused both of them to be equally responsible for the demolition of the Babri Masjid. She also said that the leak of the report of the Liberhan Commission that probed the demolition of the mosque was a joint conspiracy of both the parties. “First they (the BJP and the Congress) by their conscious acts of commission and omission ensured that the 16th century mosque was demolished, the two parties again ensured that the Commission appointed by the Rao Government to probe the incident and submit its report within six months drag on for 17 years and after it finally submitted its report, the two parties made sure that it is leaked to the media before it is table in Parliament so that no other important issue concerning the common gets proper attention for debate and decision,” Maya said. She said the aim behind every move of these two parties was to divide the people along communal lines and draw political mileage. CPM general secretary Prakash Karat on Wednesday demanded immediate action be taken against all the 68 people named as culprits in the Liberhan Commission Report on the 1992 demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. “Over the years, cases have been booked against only some of these leaders; now that the report is clear, there must be no delay acting against the rest too,” Karat told reporters here. At the same time, Karat opined that in the 17 years after the incident, the report has failed to respond to the gravity of the incident. Karat also faulted the report for exonerating then Prime Minister late P V Narasimha Rao (Congress) over his government’s failure to prevent the demolition or protect the mosque. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/nation\/2009\/nov\/26\/congress-at-pains-to-defend-rao-107384.html"}

The National Thermal Power Corporation has threatened to stop power supply to BSES Yamuna if the Reliance Infra-backed company does not pay its dues. The company said this would lead to 10-hour daily power cuts. BYPL told the Delhi government that it was unable to clear the dues of power generation companies due to a precarious cash flow situation.

The Left have been wiped out,\" Gandhi said at a rally here. \"Jo jaise karega, woh waisa bharega. (As you sow so shall you reap),\" Gandhi said in what is perhaps her first reaction to the results of elections to assemblies in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry. The Left was trounced in West Bengal, giving way to Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress that fought the elections with the Congress; in Assam, the Congress came back for a third consecutive term; in Kerala, the party-led United Democratic Front won narrowly; in Tamil Nadu, the alliance with the DMK lost out to J. Jayalalithaa's AIADMK and in Puducherry the breakaway All India NR Congress emerged victorious. Gandhi also hit out at the Mayawati-led Uttar Pradesh government. \"There is anarchy everywhere, misrule is all pervasive and there is a conspiracy of corruption,\" she told the gathering of about 30,000 people. \"No one is here to listen to the public. All these things would not be tolerated by the Congress,\" Gandhi added during her speech that lasted for about 20 minutes. She did not directly name Bhatta-Parsaul, the twin villages that have emerged as the epicentre of the agitation against land acquisition by the Uttar Pradesh government for an expressway project, but specifically mentioned the atrocities on farmers. Her son and Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi has taken up the issue in a big way, staging a daylong sit-in at the village after four people, including two police personnel, were killed in clashes. He has also alleged that women were raped and several people killed in the area in Greater Noida near the national capital. \"Hum bahut sharminda hai (We are deeply ashamed),\" Gandhi said. The land acquisition bill, she said, would be taken up by parliament soon. Without naming any party, she referred to the allegations of corruption against the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the centre and said: \"No political party has taken the stringent action (against corruption) as our party.\" \"People in glass houses should not go throw stones,\" she added. The venue of the two-day Congress convention had to be shifted to the Beniyabagh grounds after heavy rains the night before. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/nation\/2011\/may\/19\/sonia-takes-on-maya-alleging-anarchy-254623.html"}

She was deposing before the court on the second day on Tuesday as part of the trial of the Chandrasekharan murder case. She told Special Judge R Narayana Pisharadi that CPM Onchiyam area secretary C H Asokan, area committee member K K Krishnan and Kunnummakkara local committee member K C Ramachandran had taken out a march in front of their house at Onchiyam raising the slogan “Chandrasekharan’s body would be draped in white cloth.” On May 4, 2012, the day on which he was murdered, Chandrasekharan left home around 12.30 pm. She came to know that he was killed at Vallikadu, only when her father and mother reached their home around 1 am on May 5, 2012, added Rema. Denying the suggestions made by defence counsel that she was producing fake statements before the court to help the prosecution, Rema informed the court that only CPM had enmity and hatred towards Chandrasekharan. CPM had not expelled Chandrasekharan and Chandrasekharan quit the party by himself as he was a real communist. She also maintained that P Kumarankutty, the Special Public Prosecutor in the case, was not an RMP leader. He was the president of the Left Coordination Committee only. Rema informed the court that she knew him. In reply to the argument of the defence counsel that the UDF used the murder of Chandrasekharan for political gain by blaming CPM for the killing, Rema told the court that this was not right. “Not only UDF leaders, Opposition Leader V S Achuthanandan, M P Veerendra Kumar, Jnanpith Awardee Mahasweta Devi, Pannyan Raveendran, Benoy Viswom, Kanam Rajendran and K S Bijimol MLA also visited our residence to condole the death of Chandrasekharan,” she added. Earlier on Monday, Rema told the court that CPM harboured deep political hatred towards her husband after he floated RMP and the poll debacle suffered by the CPM in Vadakara Parliament constituency in 2009 and panchayat polls in 2010. CPM leaders hatched a conspiracy and killed him brutally using hired killers. The deposition of Rema concluded on Tuesday and the court has decided not to examine witnesses Abhinand, son of Chandrasekharan, K K Madhavan, father-in law of Chandrasekharan, Chandran of Onchiyam and Renjith of Onchiyam in the case. The deposition of RMP leader and eighth witness N Venu and 11th witness Achuthan of Eramala will be held at the court on Wednesday.

Patil said despite Naidu and his colleagues being \"looked after well\", there were still reports in Andhra Pradesh on how he was being \"ill-treated\". The former Andhra Pradesh chief minister was shifted to a prison in Aurangabad this morning from Dharmabad ITI, where he was lodged after he refused bail since his arrest on July 16. The Home Minister said that Naidu, who demanded that he be allowed to inspect the Babli barrage construction site, was arrested for violating section 144 of the CrPC. Naidu's judicial remand was extended till July 26 Monday after he insisted on visiting the site and refused to accept bail. Patil's statement came when Leader of opposition Eknath Khadse demanded that the government spell out its stand on the Babli controversy. He said Naidu has caused problems for the State and should be sent back immediately. Shiv Sena legislator said the controversy surrounding Naidu over the Babli row had caused tremendous tension in the State and alleged that the government's initial response was confusing. \"Naidu should have been stopped at the border itself and not allowed to enter the state,\" he said.? Patil responded saying that?Naidu was allowed inside to prevent any untoward incident since there were mobs?on both sides of the border. \"Maharashtra and Andhra enjoy excellent relationship but Naidu's political stunt is spoiling that relationship,\" he said. Patil said the next hearing on the Babli issue in the Supreme Court is on August 10 and added, \"We are committed to protecting Maharashtra's interests.\" PWP leader Ganpatrao Deshmukh alleged that Naidu had come to Maharashtra to gain instant publicity. \"Cases against him should be withdrawn and he should be sent back to his home state,\" he demanded. MNS group leader Bala Nandgaonkar said Naidu was not just a former chief minister but also a national leader. \"His act of entering Maharashtra is like encroaching into other's territory which is against culture and protocol,\" he alleged. Meanwhile, TDP legislators leaders alleged that they were roughed up by Maharashtra police while being shifted to Harsul prison in Aurangabad. TDP MLC Y B Rajendra Prasad, who was among those who faced police action in Dharmabad, said over phone that Naidu and others were \"indiscriminately manhandled\". The TDP leader's shirt was torn in the melee and police drove his personal security guards away from the scene, he claimed. Maharashtra police also overlooked the fact that Naidu was \"sick\" as he had observed a day-long fast yesterday and spent over four days without proper facilities, he said. Mobile phones of some legislators were also damaged. MLC Sidda Raghavaiah, MLAs K Dayakar Reddy, Gampa Govardhan were injured in the action. Former AP Home Minister T Devender Goud was also manhandled, Prasad alleged. In Dharmabad ITI campus, more than a 1,000 Maharashtra police personnel arrived to shift the TDP leaders, whose judicial remand has been extended till July 26, to a prison in Aurangabad. TDP leaders in Hyderabad strongly condemned the \"barbaric\" act of Maharashtra police. Former Union Minister K Yerran Naidu, former Home Minister Kodela Siva Prasada Rao and senior leaders Tummala Nageswara Rao strongly condemned the police action and held Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister K Rosaiah responsible for this.

Hundreds of activists of pro-CPM feeder organisations greeted CPM leader Jayarajan with cheers as he came out of the jail on Wednesday. Jubilant workers mobbed Jayarajan as he came out of the jail accompanied by V Sivankutty MLA, former mayor and CPM leader Jayan Babu among many others. As soon as he came out from the jail, the activists greeted him with red garlands. The police had a tough time to control the crowd, while mediapersons were trying hard to capture the event. Jayarajan along with hundreds of Left supporters proceeded to the nearby Poojappura ground, where the CPM accorded a grand reception for him. Speaking at the function, Jayarajan demanded that the UDF government should promulgate an ordinance based on a resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly allowing roadside meetings. The right to conduct roadside meetings was a fundamental right of the people in a vibrant democracy. ‘’It was Mahatma Gandhi who called for people to join in to protest against the British Government’s order banningroadside meetings. If Oommen Chandy is a true follower of Gandhi , he should promulgate an ordinance allowing roadside meetings,’’ he demanded. Jayarajan, who said that he read 12 books including those written by Fidel Castro, AKG, EMS and Gandhi, during his nine days in prison, quoted Lenin and said that in a democracy everyone can come in for criticism except two, a dead body and the foetus. “This is not a struggle against judiciary. Judiciary is the ultimate place where common man can approach to get justice. Judiciary itself had asked the common man to protest against the price rise. If the roadside meetings are curbed then it will also affect the religious festivals including the upcoming Xmas carols and Attukal Pongala,’’ he said.

The University was sanctioned a fund of `10 lakh to set up seven study centres on Sree Sankaracharya, Sree Narayana Guru, Mahatma Gandhi, Ayyankali, Chattambi Swamikal, Agamananda Swamikal and an Inter Religious Study Centre about three years ago. But Vice-Chancellor J Prasad and the syndicate members of the University have closed down the study centres and opened a centre, School of Renaissance, in the University, which has attracted widespread criticism. About 28 organisations under the banner of Confederation of Sanathana Dharma Suhruth Vedi launched agitations about 20 months ago demanding that the study centres be opened. Kerala University has 33 study centres while Calicut University and MG University have several study centres on reformist leaders. There is no justification for Sanskrit University in closing the study centres for which the fund was allotted, Vedi Convener Prof P V Peethambaran said. The action of the Sanskrit University under the initiative of Vice-Chancellor J Prasad to stop the study centres on social reformists like Mahatma Gandhi who led a non-violent struggle against the colonial rule, terrorism and communal hatred and the study centre on inter-religious study was anti-national, said Vedi working chairman Prof KSR Panikar. By doing so, VC Prasad was indirectly promoting the communal hatred and terrorism. The Suhruth Vedi activists were on a war path demonstrating various forms of peaceful agitations in Kalady, Angamaly, Thiruvananthapuram, etc. However, the agitation will be intensified by forming action committees in Aluva, Perumbavoor, Chalakudy, Manjapra, Thuravoor and Malayattoor, said SNDP Aluva Union Secretary K N Divakaran. In Aluva the formation of the action committee will be inaugurated by the Confederation of Sanathana Dharma Suhruth Samithi Chairman K K Karnan at Dr Ambedkar Memorial Hall on Zeenath Road on Sunday at 10 am, Aluva Region Coordinator K Raghavan said.

AP PATNA: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasasd and his wife Rabri Devi are elated with the overwhelming success of the dawn-to-dusk statewide shutdown called by the party to protest rising prices of essential items. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, on the other hand, said Thursday's shutdown was opposed to development. \"Yes, we are happy that, after all, people's anger was reflected and evident with the total success of the shutdown in Bihar,\" Lalu Prasad told IANS here Friday. He added that the shutdown was supported by the people. The RJD chief said his party, along with its ally Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Left parties, will expose the \"double standards\" of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government led by Nitish Kumar in Bihar. \"People, particularly poorest of the poor Mahadalits, are dying of hunger and government schemes are not reaching them due to rampant corruption but Nitish Kumar is busy singing 'shining Bihar' like 'shining India'. It has angered the people,\" he said. However, Nitish Kumar termed the shutdown opposed to development. Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said it was another example of terror and a warning to the people of the \"return of jungle raj\". The dawn-to-dusk shutdown evoked total response in Bihar, upsetting Lalu-Rabri rival Nitish Kumar as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, which is trying for a revival in the state. In contrast, RJD leaders and workers are upbeat and see a new ray of hope ahead of the state assembly polls due in November. Till a few days ago, the RJD was described as a spent force and its leader - Lalu Prasad - had been written off. But the shutdown success has provided the much-needed shot in the arm to him to take on the state's ruling Janata Dal-United (JD-U) and its ally, the BJP. Political analyst Satyanarain Madan said Lalu-Rabri for the first time made a political mark by a near total shutdown after their ouster from power in 2005 in Bihar and after Lalu Prasad lost his place in the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance central government last year after his party was routed in the Lok Sabha polls. According to police reports from different districts, nearly 12,000 workers and leaders of the RJD were arrested during the shutdown but later released. Lalu Prasad, Rabri Devi and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan were arrested, along with dozens of other leaders in Patna. The shutdown was supported by RJD's ally LJP and the Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India-Marxist and Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist. In September last year, the RJD-LJP alliance surprised all when they performed better than expected in the by-elections to 18 assembly seats in Bihar. The opposition alliance bagged nine seats, while the ruling coalition of the JD-U and BJP won just five. The vote was then seen as a mini referendum for the Nitish Kumar government and termed as a semi-final. Its outcome in favour of RJD-LJP alliance upset Nitish Kumar as he had expected a clean sweep in the elections. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/nation\/2010\/jan\/29\/lalu-rabri-upbeat-after-success-of-shutdown-165462.html"}

A bench of Justice Tarun Chatterjee and Justice Aftab Alam also deferred to Sep 2 the issue of transferring the case for further investigation to a special probe panel headed by former Central Bureau of Investigation director R.K. Raghavan. The bench ordered the payment of the monetary relief to the slain man's family members within a week, accepting the offer of Rs.1 million made by senior counsel Mukul Rohtagi on behalf of the Gujarat government. The state government had already accepted the criminal liability of some of its police officials in carrying out the killing of the Ujjain man and also his wife Kausar Bi in Ahmedabad in November 2005. The court order came on a lawsuit by Sohrabuddin Sheikh's terminally ill brother Rubabuddin Sheikh, who has sought a CBI probe into the killings of his brother and sister-in-law. Though the compensation offer was promptly accepted by Rubabuddin Sheikh's counsel Dushyant Dave, Justice Aftab Alam wanted the government to hike the compensation. \"We accept it,\" said Dave, the moment Rohtagi disclosed the government's offer of Rs.1 million as an \"interim ex-gratia\". \"We accept it as we are quite desperate,\" said the lawyer, who had earlier told the court that Rubabuddin Sheikh was terminally ill with a \"stage III cancer.\" Justice Chatterjee too agreed with the offer, ignoring Justice Alam's reservation over the sum and said, \"I was thinking only in terms of thousands.\" Dave also sought to raise a demand of compensation for Sohrabuddin Sheikh's friend Tulsiram Prajapati, who too had allegedly been shot dead by the Gujarat police team in another staged gun battle. But the plea did not evoke any response from the bench, while the state government too asserted that it does admit the allegations that Prajapati's killing was extra-judicial. The bench deferred the issue of transferring the case to the special probe panel after Rohtagi asserted that the state government was not amenable to transfer the probe and said he would like to argue on the legal issues involved. Sohrabuddin Sheikh, Kausar Bi and Prajapati were killed after their alleged abduction by the Gujarat police. Then deputy inspector general D.G. Vanzara had announced Sohrabuddin Sheikh's killing in a police shootout, dubbing him a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist on a mission to assassinate Chief Minister Narendra Modi and other prominent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders. However, the state government admitted the killings were staged. In a subsequent probe, police have arrested Vanzara and three other senior police officers, who are still behind the bars. The killings had become a major issue of debate between Modi and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in the run-up to the state assembly elections in December 2007. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/nation\/2009\/aug\/11\/pay-ex-gratia-to-sohrabuddins-kin-sc-76819.html"}

AIADMK functionary Rajagopal was attacked with crude bombs by an unidentified gang on January 28 while he was travelling on a motorbike. Though he escaped the impact of the bombs, the gang chased and hacked him to death in full view of the public. Subsequently, the police arrested six persons in connection with the murder and eight others turned themselves in. However, on Friday, Rajagopalan’s wife Jaya, also an AIADMK functionary, alleged that except one person, none of those arrested were actually involved in the murder. She alleged that the real perpetrators had paid these men to surrender in the case. About 50 relatives of Rajagopalan put up a shed and began a hunger strike at around 9 am at the spot where Rajagopalan was hacked. The protest continued until 12.30 pm. Police officers arrived on the spot and promised action and convinced Jaya to stop the protest.

A party of J&K police’s Special Operations Group (SOG) conducted midnight raid on the residence of 80-year-old social activist and religious preacher Abdul Qayoom Bhat at Kamla Bachoo village in Tral in South Kashmir’s Pulwama district during the night. The cops were looking for Bhat’s son Shabir Ahmad Fallahi, an official of politico-religious organisation Jamaat-e-Islami. “As Shabir was not present in the house, the cops dragged and arrested his elder brother Noor Muhamamad Bhat. They beat him and bundled him into the policy gypsy,” a member of the Bhat family said. He said when Abdul Qayoom (80) and his wife Nazeera Begum (75) resisted the police action, cops fired pellets and bullets at them. In the police action, Qayoom sustained pellet injures while his wife was hit by a bullet on her shoulder. Both the injured were taken to hospital in Tral, where from doctors referred critically injured Qayoom to SMHS hospital in Srinagar for specialized treatment. “Qayoom has undergone surgery for pellet injuries.

Meanwhile, social activist Swami Agnivesh and members of Delhi Minorities Association came out in Thampu's support and said a \"mala fide campaign\" is run against him and efforts are being made to influence the course of law. Claiming that he is being chased as an \"animal\", Thampu maintained that his lawyer and former judge Manmohan Sarin had told him long before that attempts were being made to trap him in this case and he should report the matter to Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). He has been claiming that the research scholar who was allegedly molested by an assistant professor, was being used against him and was \"coached to do a sting on him\" by the \"handlers\" of the controversy. Though the principal referred to the Old Stephanians Association, an alumni group which is not recognised by the college, as one of the elements who he alleged are after him, he did not reveal the names of others saying \"the obvious need not be stated\". \"I have done my best in the capacity of a principal... but at the end of the day I am a human. I have a wife and two daughters who also live in the society. Since the matter is sub-judice I appeal all the elements concerned that this constant character assassination of me as well as the college should be avoided,\" he said during a press conference. Thampu also claimed that he is being dragged into the row which was supposed to be between the complainant and the accused but the principal has become the \"principal offender\" in the case. Reiterating his demand for a CBI enquiry into the issue, he said that, \"I want a comprehensive, unprejudiced enquiry to be conducted and the truth to be revealed. I also welcome the HRD ministry and UGC for their intervention into the proceedings of ICC.\" Batting for Thampu, Swami Agnivesh said, \"An entire lobby is working against him including the alumni association. The media trial of the issue is a wrong thing to be done. The matter is before court, let it be take care there.\" \"Why stage protests and intrude into campus's activities? Why should we be judges and advocates in the matter? Certain alumni are hounding him as hunting dogs. We should realise that individuals come and go but the reputation of college suffers,\" he said. Scores of students, teachers and women rights organisations had yesterday staged a protest outside college demanding Thampu's resignation for shielding the accused. He had said that he would resign if \"it is objectively proved that he is an embarrassment to the institution\". While the UGC official who is in-charge of the enquiry was believed to have been told by college authorities that lack of resources and cooperation from other members has led to a delay in the enquiry, Thampu said it should be reported to him about who from the college did not cooperate. \"If anyone from the college doesn't cooperate, I have all the authority to force them to do so. I cannot however give a time-frame for the ICC probe to be completed,\" he said.

Nine-hour power supply to farming sector, `200 bonus on paddy, removal of VAT on agricultural produce, free distribution of 50 kg rice to affected families, waiver of crop loans, implementation of a comprehensive crop insurance scheme by taking the survey number as a unit, release of compensation directly to tenant farmers, `1 lakh ex-gratia to the kin of those killed due to rains, crop loans under Pavala Vaddi scheme, linking the agriculture sector with that of NREGP (National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme) were among the other demands putforth by him. “The TDP, if needed, will include all these issues in the election manifesto,” he added. Referring to his visits to the affected districts, the opposition leader warned that the people, particularly the farmers, would lose faith on the parliamentary democratic system if the government neglected them. There was a need to amend the procedures to enable the government to procure the damaged crop from the suffering farmers. “Justice will not be done to the victims if chief minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy does not pursue the issues sincerely,” he remarked. As per the government figures, crop was damaged in about 10.75 lakh hectares (about 25 lakh acres) due to floods and heavy rains during the kharif season. Both the state and central governments should come to the rescue of suffering farmers. About `2,000 crore loss was reported in Guntur district alone, while heavy losses were also reported in districts like Nalgonda, East Godavari, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Nellore.

Despite several rounds of joint combing operations, the police and the forest officials are yet to get a clear evidence to confirm Maoist operations in the state. Though the officials from the state police department had visited the encounter site in which a Maoist cadre was killed, the police was not able to establish any Kerala connection with the incident. “There are specific reports that Maoists are expanding their base to Kerala through Wayanad, especially concentrating at the ‘tri-junction’ which borders Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. But it is yet to locate any hideouts or get definite evidence regarding their operations in the areas,” said a top police official. He further said that after receiving information from the Karnataka Police that extremists might have sneaked into the forests area in Wayanad, police, along with officials of the Forest Department had conducted joint combing operations in forest areas bordering Karnataka last week. “So far, nothing suspicious has been found and we are closely monitoring the situation,” the official added. He also said that a decision has already been taken to intensify the combing operations including those deep into the forests and to review the situation on a regular basis. Police sources further said that though it is yet to garner evidence to prove that tribal settlements in the border areas of Wayanad have been used for extremist operations, they are not ruling out the possibilities of recruitments from these areas. “At present, activities of the groups related to Maoists are reportedly concentrated at Nilambur forests and areas bordering Malappuram and Palakkad. Though there were reports that Maoist sympathisers had visited the tribal colonies in Wayanad and are expanding their base especially along the tri-junction, we have not yet been able to establish the fact.

If you think these are cliched writings of a desi journo, well you need to meet Aishwarya Sridhar, a 11th Grade student of Dr Pillai Global Academy in Mumbai. And, you would agree, she is different. She is our special guest onboard this International Women's Day special issue. Yes, she's a girl among the women! “I still remember visiting Bangalore's Bannerghatta National Park, while I was a kid. My passion for wildlife rather the birth of my wild chase started from Bangalore. Since then, I have never looked back. Today, the only thing that matters to me is the animal kingdom. While tigers have found a special place in my heart, I am absolutely in love with everything I spot in the wild. The birds in and around Navi Mumbai know me very well,” Aishwarya told City Express, adding: “I think the birds stop for me and pose every time I am out on a shooting spree.” Today, she rubs shoulders with some of the the top-ranked wildlife photographers in India. She is sought-after by leading national TV channels and invited by schools for presentations.NGOs seek her inputs and wildlife magazines chase her for stories from the forest. “As an active volunteer of Green Peace, I attended a vigil against the Jaitapur Nuclear Plant, at Bandra Bandstand in 2011 and recited my poem ‘Invitation to Death’ to a large audience. I am currently documenting the bird life of Panvel, Uran and Karnala. I have till date photographed and recorded patterns of over 180 birds during the last year alone,” says Aishwarya, who has penned over 50 poems on her wildlife friends. She has also voiced her concerns over Bangalore's Hesaraghatta lake. “I might be young but I am clear about my mission.

If Thangkabalu fails to do so the movement will launch a massive campaign to defeat him in the hustings. The Tamil Nadu Toddy Movement, which comprises about 300 farmer’s associations in the State, launched a law breaking protest on January 21, 2009 demanding the ban on toddy lifted. On the same day TNCC President Thangkabalu led a fast in Chennai in favor of total prohibition including toddy. The counter protest by the TNCC chief raised a furore with the Movement with its coordinator S Nallusamy saying Thangkabalu “had insulted the feelings of farmers, coconut and Palmyra tree climbers consumers and nature lovers.” A few days back Thangkabalu told reporters in Salem that he had decided on the date for his protest three months ago and did not intend it to be a counter protest to that started by the toddy farmers. He further stated that he was trying to patch up with the Toddy Movement by offering to take their demands into consideration. According to Nallusamy, Thangkabalu’s stand was in contravention to the official AICCC stand, which stated that total prohibition was impossible to implement in the country. As per the decision of some constituent associations in the Toddy movement it was decided in Thanjavur at a meeting of the Cauvery Delta Farmer’s Association two days ago that fielding 1000 candidates against Thangkabalu would be an act against the Election Commission. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/tamil-nadu\/2009\/apr\/22\/thangkabalu-wont-get-a-kick-43026.html"}

The butcher, A Illamparuthi, in his petition, alleged that the ministerial staff had over the past year slaughtered 26 goats which had strayed into the minister’s premises in Paramakudi for grazing. During one such occasion, when he had gone in search of a missing goat, the minister’s Personal Assistant Sivanandham had allegedly claimed that the goat had already landed on the dining table. Later, when Illamparuthi along with members of the Gokula Yadavar Sangam took up the matter with Sundararaj, the latter had allegedly instructed the Paramakudi Town Police Inspector to register cases against the petitioner and his friends. The petitioner claimed that the police obliged the minister and registered cases against them. Since the police did not give him permission to observe a fast against the minister and his staff, Illamparuthi moved the court. On Wednesday, when the matter came up for hearing before Justice K K Sasidharan, his counsel withdrew the petition stating that the police had granted permission to hold the fast in front of Paramakudi Taluk office, on March 27. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/tamil-nadu\/2012\/mar\/29\/butcher-withdraws-plea-after-cops-permit-fast-353300.html"}

The assurance came after the delegation, led by NDA working chairman L K Advani, called on the Prime Minister on Monday evening, demanding rejection of the report sent by the Governor to the Centre recommending dismissal of the B S Yeddyurappa- led BJP government and asking for the recall of Governor H R Bhardwaj. Similarly, in Bangalore, the BJP legislature party passed a resolution demanding the recall of the Governor besides announcing the launch of a state-wide agitation if President’s rule was clamped. In Delhi, Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj told the Prime Minister, “You will also be happy and we will also be happy if the Governor is recalled.” The BJP leadership feels that the Governor is unnecessarily making things difficult for the UPA government by making a case against the democratically elected Karnataka government, when there is no case against him. In the half-an-hour-long meeting with Prime Minister Singh, the NDA delegation made a strong case against Bhardwaj for his recall as Governor, stressing that ever since his appointment in the last three years, he has been taking steps that violate the very spirit of the Constitution. Objecting to his refusal to convene the state Assembly, the NDA leaders told the Prime Minister that as per the various court rulings on the imposition of President’s rule in the states and invoking Article 356, the strength of the state government is tested only on floor of the Assembly and not in the Raj Bhavan. Keeping up the heat against the Governor, BJP MLAs numbering 121 will be paraded before President Pratibha Patil on Tuesday evening. Yeddyurappa and his Cabinet colleagues left in three batches for Delhi to participate in the parade. Soon after the meeting, BJP legislators staged a dharna demanding Bhardwaj’s recall for his “undemocratic conduct”, even as the state Cabinet urged him to accord permission to convene a 10-day legislature session from June 2. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/karnataka\/2011\/may\/17\/no-flouting-statute-on-karnataka-pm-253889.html"}

Not just the CBI, but the Congress government has also tried to do the maximum misuse of other constitutional authorities in the country,\" said BJP President Rajnath Singh, when asked about CBI investigations into the Ishrat Jahan encounter case. Ishrat Jahan, a 19-year-old college student was killed along with three others on June 15, 2004 allegedly by a team of Crime Branch officials on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, after intelligence inputs that a group of Lashkar terrorists have plotted to kill Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi to avenge the 2002 communal riots in the state. The BJP has been stung by reports claiming that the CBI has come with fresh evidence that Modi and the then Gujarat Home Minister Amit Shah had prior knowledge of the alleged fake encounter of Ishrat Jahan. Singh, after addressing a congregation of weavers here today, also charged the Congress governments with lowering the dignity of constitutional authorities in the country. \"If anyone has done the work of lowering the dignity of constitutional authorities in the country, it is the Congress government,\" he said. Asked to respond to the Election Commission notice on BJP leader Gopinath Munde, the BJP chief said, \"I have not heard Munde's speech. But if the Election Commission has sent a notice to Munde, he will reply.\" Earlier, addressing a weavers congregation here today, Singh favoured loan waiver for them on the lines of the relief extended to farmers. He alleged that the Congress has not done enough to alleviate poverty from the country in its almost 55 years of rule and charged the ruling with conspiring to sustain poverty due to its politics. \"If the poor have remained poor, it is not because of their misfortune but because of the bad intentions of the government in power,\" Singh said. He said, \"It is a conspiracy by those in power not to allow people to shed their poverty.... I feel those sitting in power think they can purchase their votes by offering them some sops before the polls.\" Rajnath promised to accord equal status to weavers and sort out their problems once BJP came to power. \"Weavers and farmers will be kept on the same yardstick. We will offer easy finance of 1 to 2 per cent on loans to weavers as offered to farmers,\" he said. He also opposed cotton exports till the demand of weavers were met in the country and sought easy finance for weavers at low interest.

Gilani, however, chose to tread on the beaten path. Asserting that “Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan”, Gilani thundered, “Pakistan will continue to provide unhindered moral, diplomatic and political support to Kashmiris so that they can get their rights.” A day later in New Delhi, 680 kilometres from Islamabad, Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh’s Independence Day speech did not contain the world ‘Pakistan’ even once. India, it appears, has opted to chase a chimera, almost infinitely. India’s Pakistan policy has come a full circle. Days and months after the November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, Pranab Mukherjee, then external affairs minister, announced a “pause” to bilateral relations till Pakistan cooperates in the investigation process. Less than three years from those days of agony and frustration, New Delhi has yet again taken a risk of initiating a process of dialogue. Hawks like former National Security Adviser (NSA) M K Narayanan have been sidelined. Home Minister P Chidambaram, a known opponent of the dialogue process, has been reformed to the point of submission. Even then, the question whether the latest initiatives from New Delhi are indeed based on some reciprocity from Islamabad remains virtually unanswered. Not only that Pakistan has refused to take actions against the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), but the outfit has been allowed as a matter of policy to propagate and garner support from an anti-India jihad throughout the country. As recently as on August 20, LeT founder Hafiz Mohammad Saeed claimed while addressing a gathering in Narowal district, “The jihad is bearing fruit in Kashmir and soon India will reach its logical end.” A statement that would surely enthuse many young men to take up a career in terrorism. Saeed exalted: “The US has had to give in to Afghanistan because of the power of jihad and now India will also surrender for the same reason.” Barely a month ago, Saeed had declared that he would enter India to launch “Gazwah-e-Hind” (battle for Hindustan) “from the door of Kashmir”. Not many would disagree that the spirit of Saeed’s assertion ran parallel to Prime Minister Gilani’s independence day declaration and possibly explains the government’s inaction against the terror formation. Islamabad continues to ask India for evidence against LeT for initiating any action. Contrast this with Pakistani gesture of dispatching the chief of ISI to Beijing within hours after China accused Pakistan-based terrorists to have carried out attacks in its Uighur province in July. Even Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the outfit which carried out the attack on the Indian Parliament, is returning from a period of hibernation. After being underground for a decade since being banned in 2001, JeM too has resumed full-scale public activity, including fundraising in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. JeM’s traditional physical and financial strength is said to have significantly dissipated during the 10-year ban imposed during the regime of former president Pervez Musharraf. Currently, the outfit is on an overdrive to claim its lost glory back, with the security force establishment looking the other way. A noted Pakistani-American scholar argued that India should not make the arrests of Lashkar terrorists “a prerequisite for substantive movement in the peace process”. Alternatively, he prescribed “moving forward with a serious peace effort internally within Kashmir, as well as with Pakistan” as “the most potent way of eroding the militant strands of the Lashkar”. Such a claim would have carried some value had the LeT been spurned by the Pakistani military as an instrument of its India policy. The Pakistan military has demonstrated no indication of giving up its nexus with the jihadis. In a recent interview, the Pakistani foreign minister, who since her appointment has been a point of attention for all the wrong reasons, claimed that the Pakistan foreign policy has come of age and the military does not play any role in deciding its nuances. Hina Rabbani Khar had multiple rounds of wisdom-induction sessions with Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, before embarking on her India trip in July. It appears that she barely managed not to utter what many believe continues to be the state of affairs in Pakistan. “The civilian government is supreme in Pakistan, the Army told me so.” The writer, a former deputy director in the National Security Council Secretariat, is a Singapore-based independent analyst.

She was speaking at the valediction function of the 11th All India Police Rifle\/Revolver\/Pistol Shooting Competition held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium. Distributing medals and trophies to winners of the five-day event in which 702 personnel from 22 State police teams and eight Central police organisations participated, the chief minister recalled the 26\/11 incidents in Mumbai to stress her point. Sivaji Terminus in Mumbai firing indiscriminately with an AK-47 on 26\/11, while a brave constable tried to return fire with a .303 rifle is still green. Unable to make any impact, he finally flings a chair at the gunman,” she said. In this context, Jayalalithaa claimed credit for modernisation of the police force throughout the country. She said that when she became chief minister for the first time in 1991, the State police did not have weaponry to combat militancy and terrorism. “Our policemen carried muskets and .303 rifles of Second World War vintage. On the other hand, the militants possessed ultra-modern, sophisticated fire-arms for which our police had no answer.” It was her pioneering efforts, which resulted in the implementation of the Modernisation of Police Force (MPF) Scheme in all states with Central assistance, she asserted. Highlighting the importance of handling the weapons effectively, she said firing had to be precise and accurate so that the terrorist was either gunned down or overpowered, leaving innocent people unharmed. “It is in this context that this competition assumes importance.” Pointing out that the competition was not a mere sporting event, where the “tussle was for medals and trophies and personal glory”, the chief minister said it was “a preparation to equip the police to face hard reality when confronted with terrorism”. Since firing range drills would help nurture shooting skills, she said she ordered the setting up of a firing range at Othivakkam in 2002 by transferring 221.95 acres of land, where the present competition was held. The chief minister said she also proposed to sanction funds for purchase of special firearms like rifles or pistols of .177 or .22 bore, so that the state police could participate in another event, All India Police Sports Shooting Championship, which was held on the pattern of Olympic shooting games. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/tamil-nadu\/2011\/sep\/09\/cant-let-cops-be-outgunned-289148.html"}

He shed the \"honorific\" of \"His Excellency\" in people addressing him and sought to reach out to them taking Rashtrapati Bhavan closer to the common man. He was seen as proactive when he disposed of the mercy petitions of 26\/11 attack convict Ajmal Kasab and Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru that had triggered a controversy but his aides explain that as President he had no choice but to go by the Cabinet advice. \"A President has to function by the book,\" Mukherjee told a journalist at an informal tea with the media in Rashtrapati Bhavan yesterday when he was asked about people calling him an active President. To mark the day, the President has a busy schedule today with back-to-back functions opening a public library for residents of Rashtrapati Bhavan, dedication of a cricket ground in the school within the President's estate, unveiling of a bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi and launch of digital initiatives linked to the President's website. During the turbulent period last year-end in the capital, the demonstrations against the rape and murder of a 23-year-old paramedical student reached the gates of Rashtrapati Bhavan seeking his intervention. Mukherjee asked the authorities to take all steps to bring the perpetrators of this \"ghastly crime\" to justice and ensure that the girl's death will not be in vain. Shaken by the ghastly crime against women and children being reported from across the country, the President in his speeches at educational institutes urged the students and the society to re-set the moral compass. Interaction with people comes naturally to Mukherjee and this has not changed during his first year as the Head of the State, an office known for maintaining strict protocol. Be it reaching out to the cheering crowd or interacting with the best brains of the country during discussions in educational institutions, Mukherjee enjoys every bit of his interactions with people. During the last one year as the President of the country of over one billion people, Mukherjee had travelled to 23 states which includes five states of northeast during which he visited 36 educational institutions. Shunning the ceremonial pomp, Mukherjee makes it a point to have an informal discussion with teachers and students whenever he is visiting an educational institute to know their point of view and convey to them his ideas. \"The Presidency has given me an opportunity to go back to academics,\" he said, recalling his days when he taught political science in a college in South 24 Parganas district in West Bengal. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/nation\/2013\/jul\/25\/Pranab-completes-one-year-in-office-500341.html"}

It is difficult to overlook the dangerous disregard of national interest that majority of the Indian media is suffering from. It turned a blind eye to the outburst of communal violence in Malda as the instigators and perpetrators didn’t belong to what is referred to as the ‘majority community’. None—who ‘shoot from the lip and the hip’ at the same time and come out both barrels blazing whenever the tattered ‘secular fabric’ appears (to them) endangered—had the courage to even whisper that this time it may have been the work of the ‘lunatic fringe’ of miscreants belonging to some other creed. Anti-social elements, smugglers, flesh traders, drug peddlers and those who deal in illicit arms do not belong to any one religion or country. If they are not identified and exposed whenever they cause bloodshed, leaving behind a trail of innocent dead and vandalised public property, those in power stand without the protection of the proverbial fig leaf. Mamata Didi lost no time in pronouncing that what happened in Malda had nothing to do with any communal conflict and was just a law and order problem. She obviously doesn’t believe that maintaining law and order is her government’s responsibility. Let us not forget that all riots—communal or secular—mark a failure of the government to avert a breakdown of law and order. If what happened in Malda was a trivial incident, why was so much trouble taken to keep the BJP and CPI(M) fact-finding team out from ‘ground zero’? The task of ‘white-washing’ was taken seriously by the administration—literally. The burnt-down police station was repaired and given a fresh coat of paint overnight. Pictures from the spot, when at long last began to appear on the screen, told a tale very different from what Didi and her minions would have us believe. It is quite possible, as has been alleged by some, that communal tinge was deliberately given to a vandalising mission, systematically executed to destroy evidence of subversive activities of illegal immigrants from across the border and their powerful political patrons. The least that is expected from anyone responsible is restraint in issuing clean chits. But why fault the politicians with an incurable squint—with eyes focused sideways on vote banks? It is the job of the media to put them in the dock and ask inconvenient questions. The double standards in this case were glaring. Partisanship of this kind can only imperil national interest. Terrorist attack on the Pathankot airbase exposed another chink in our media armour. ‘Eloquence’ out of place can be as perilous as silence when speaking out was required. The temptation to break news before a rival channel does, can and, in the past, has had fatal consequences. Not for the celebrity reporter-anchors but for poor men in uniform combating the enemy. There can be no place for unfettered and exclusive right to freedom of media in any democracy however vibrant. Minute-to-minute eye-witness accounts and excerpts of knee-jerk comments from blatantly partisan analysts not only jeopardise a counter-terrorist operation underway, but can also seriously demoralise the men in uniform. The Pathankot incident too exposed how far the malignant cancer of corruption has spread. It is not just that a senior officer of the Punjab Police is under suspicion, some men in the Army and Air Force too have fallen in the honey or money trap. Once again, eager beavers of the media on the perpetual lookout to perform a hatchet job on their respective ‘hit lists’ rushed to write between lines lest we fail to ‘read’ the blank space. They shouted themselves hoarse drawing the battle of turf between the Army, Air Force and Punjab Police. Without a pause to catch their breath, they insinuated that what we were watching was the tip of an iceberg—a massive smuggling operation gone wrong and to fill the background, dramatic re-enactments of the modus operandi with complicity of rotten eggs in the BSF were screened. The home minister was not spared either. Speculative reports based on unnamed sources launched rumour-mongering kites to inform us how unhappy he was at being ‘left out of the loop’.

Moreover, politicians didn’t object to Prof. M Kodandaram heading the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of political parties for separate Telangna, perhaps, realising that people had lost faith in them. May be, they have stepped back respecting people’s sentiments and conceded leadership to a professor. ``I do not believe in politicians that they will achieve separate Telangana,’’ opined a student, who participated in the Vidyarthi Garjana yesterday in the city. Humble and soft spoken in nature, Kodandaram has successfully been coordinating the politicians of various parties with different ideologies. It seems, they have no qualms to work under the leadership of an educationist. G Haragopal, a retired professor who taught political science at the University of Hyderabad and Kakatiya University, remarked that a professor leading a JAC of politicians was a welcome change. ``It is another social process,’’ he said endorsing the leadership of his colleague. For that matter, Haragopal himself took a proactive role in the ongoing Telangana movement by supporting students, who vowed to continue the agitation till Telangana was carved out. It may be mentioned that Jayashankar, a retired professor of Kakatiya University has been in the forefront of Telangana movement. He has been the ideologue of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), whose main agenda is to achieve separate State. Terming `professors leading the movement’ a welcome sign, the Telangana NGOs president K Swamy Goud attributed the development to their credibility. May be taking cue from Telangana movement, United Andhra JAC of politicians which has been opposing bifurcation of the State decided to work under the leadership of professor Samuel from Nagarjuna University. It appears, people are gradually losing faith in politicos and parties and the void is being filled by professors. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/andhra-pradesh\/2010\/jan\/05\/professors-leading-movements-a-welcome-change-118987.html"}

There was a huge backlog of posts reserved for the disabled in various government departments, he said. “The ruling Congress which is claiming credit for increasing the pension for the disabled from Rs 200 to Rs 500, seems to be not aware of the disabled welfare programmes being implemented in other States.

They are protesting discrimination among farmers by the district administration. Koraput administration had allowed sale of up to 100 quintal paddy by each small farmer in different mandis and banned entry of middle and big farmers having capacity to sell beyond 100 quintals to easy the burden of Government officials. The district administration opened 37 mandis, twice a week, in Jeypore sub-division about a month back and limited the transaction per mandi to 3,500 quintal of paddy per mandi on the demand of procuring agencies. The decision has come as a boon for middlemen who are exploiting the farmers who are unable to sell at the mandis. Farmers are selling their paddy to middlemen outside mandis at Rs 1,100 per quintal, about `300 less than the Government price for more than one month. The farmers demand to increase the ceiling on paddy procurement per mandi to 5000 quintal and allow middle and big farmers sell their stock went unheard. Several appeals by the farmer leaders to review the paddy procurement process and allow all sections of farmers sell their produce at mandis too went in vain.

These regular yatris from Lutyens’ Delhi to Lahore are more concerned about their evening parties where champagne is spilled than about the blood spattered all over the streets of Pakistan and in Mumbai during 26\/11. If any more evidence of Pakistan being the most favoured and safest haven for terrorists was required, it was there in the form of the audacious attack on the Karachi naval base last week. Earlier, the US army killed the Badshah of Terror Osama bin Laden in an area that was barely a few kilometres away from the seat the Pak military establishment. In the US, David Headley left no one in doubt during his ongoing trial that he was trained and funded by the Pakistan’s dreaded and unconstitutional ISI. Headley even gave details about the names of Pakistani officials, terror funds and terror attacks planned against India. Yet Indian peaceniks have turned their backs to the facts and plugged their ears. While American opinion makers are furious over Headley’s revelations and confessions, Indian authorities have chosen to hide behind diplomatic camouflage. While the US is waging its war on ISI-sponsored terror, Indians are debating through media and TV channels on how to make Pakistan a stable and viable state. Predictably, the US is speaking with a forked tongue. One argues for the safety of their country and its strategic interests. Another advises India to wait and watch, which means let the ISI divert its terror outfits to hit at will on Indian soil. It is amazing that our leaders and cheerleaders for Pakistan behave like ostriches. In private, however, they admit that Pakistan is the global godfather of terror. Even a hardcore diplomat-turned-politician like Natwar Singh admitted during a TV interview, which he gave as India’s foreign minister in 2004, that Pakistan was a failed state. But fearing diplomatic disaster, he withdrew his remark before it was telecast. He, and all those who both preceded and followed him to South Block, held almost similar views but never spoke their mind in the presence of colleagues or fellow diplomats. Hardly a day passes without women losing their husbands, children their parents and mothers their children in Pakistan, but its rulers instead of flushing out the killers boast about targeting India and that too on the floor of their parliament. General Pasha, the man whose ruling passion is harbouring and training terrorists isn’t bothered about the implications of his warmongering. Why should he? He was, after all, addressing a captive house that enjoys only a token mandate from the people of Pakistan. None of them dared question the ISI chief about his dangerous plans to attack Indian defence and civil installations. Meanwhile, as Pasha was spewing venom, our leaders were still talking about talks. From Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to most Congress leaders, all pleaded for an incensed India to ignore the hawkish boast of a frustrated military establishment across the border. Moreover, American leaders visiting the subcontinent were exhorting their Indian counterparts to restrain themselves from speaking the same language as Pakistanis. Even the American collaborators in India are more active now than they have ever been before. Using foreign-funded think tanks, they have mounted pressure on Indian political, corporate and social circles to prevent the Government from taking any sort of action against Pakistan. None of them has spoken out for the repatriation of 45 fugitives, including Dawood Ibrahim who lives like a monarch in Pakistan. Not even a single NGO has demanded the dismantling of terror camps operating across the LOC. Instead, they go about collecting crowds and inviting Pak chatteratti and glitteratti to participate in Indian cultural festivals in return for generous remuneration. Even India’s hawkish Home Minister P Chidambaram admitted in a candid interview that while India has a limited capacity to undertake an Osama-type operation in Pakistan, it has constraints. It is clear that even his hands are tied. For the past few months, as more and more evidence against Pakistan’s patronage of terrorism surfaces, Indian movers and shakers retreat further into their shells. While candlelight peace processions and seminars have almost vanished, so have those who were aggressively advocating an offensive against Pakistan; instead they are seen participating in seminars and conventions abroad. Escaping the summer heat seems to be more important than turning up the heat on Pakistan. Suddenly our over-enthusiastic defence chiefs also have lost their bravado and have stopped giving vent to their inner feelings. Defence Minister (Saint) A K Antony always preaches tolerance, even in the wake of serious provocation. Chidambaram will be reflecting the mood of the nation if he demands a level-playing field for Indian forces when he meets US Secretary for Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. Chidambaram should demand the destruction of the evil empire of terror, whose access to Pakistan’s nukes will always be an ominous possibility. It can be done with US cooperation. Or if need be, in spite of them. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/prabhu-chawla\/pc-columns\/2011\/may\/29\/why-the-softness-on-pakistan-257586.html"}

The brief trip of 62-year-old Ashraf to the 13th century shrine hit a sour note following a boycott by the Dargahs spiritual head in protest against the recent brutal killing and beheading of Indian soldiers by the Pakistani Army. Opposing the Pakistan premier's visit that was marked by tight security, local lawyers, some BJP activists and representatives of markets associations staged protests and shouted anti-Pakistan slogans. After he offered 'chadar' and floral tributes, Ashraf prayed for peace in the world and prosperity in Pakistan. \"Me and my family members are fortunate to get the opportunity to visit the dargah. I thank you Garib nawaz. I wish for peace in the world and for peace and prosperity in Pakistan,\" the Prime Minister wrote in Urdu in the visitors book. Ashraf, on a short visit to India, along with his wife Nusrat and over 20 others including his relatives offered prayers at the Dargah and stayed inside the historic shrine for about 30 minutes. He was assisted by the khadims in his prayers. Clad in cream coloured sherwani and a white and round cap, Ashraf carried a 42-metre multicoloured velvet Chadar--a ceremonial cloth inscribed with religious verses--and flowers on his head for offering it to the Sufi saints mausoleum where a 'ziyarat' was performed by his family khadim Syed Bilal Chisti. Turban tying (Dastarbandi) was another ceremony that took place in the shrine. Tight security arrangements were in place in view of threats by advocates to protest the visit and over 1,000 police personnel guarded the entire stretch from the helipad to the Dargah. Police used mild force to disperse a group of advocates who had gathered at Favvara circle to show black flags to the Prime Minister in his way back to the Ghughra helipad. The VVIP cavalcade, however, passed through a different route and reached the helipad, police said. The Pakistani delegation was received at the main gate of the Dargah, Nizam gate, by the bodies of Khadims (clerics). As he stepped into the Dargah, Ashraf was welcomed by the beating of drums (Shadiyane) as per the traditions and customs of the shrine. The delegation then proceeded towards the Aastana (shrine) after passing through Shahjahani gate, Buland darwaja, Sandali gate and Ahta-e-Noor (boundary of the main shrine). Before getting into the shrine from Begami Dalan (main entrance of the shrine), he was introduced to shrine keys holders (baridar). The Premer then performed Fateha (supplication) and went around the premises through mosques, graves of the Khwajas disciples and two big cauldrons used for cooking food during the annual Urs. Ashraf and his delegation landed at Ghughra helipad on the outskirts of the city by helicopters from Jaipur where External Affairs Salman Khurshid hosted a lunch for the guests. Police and District administration officials received the dignitary before they moved to the Dargah sharif by road from the helipad--a distance of 13 km. Dargah committee CEO Mohammd Afzal received them inside the shrine after his entry from the Nizam gate. He was also honoured by the Dargah committee at Buland darwaja before his departure to the helipad. The Dargah premises was evacuated after noon for the visit and only pass holders were allowed to stay inside the dargah during the visit of Ashraf and his family members. Ajmer Sharif Dargah Diwan, Zainul Abedin Ali Khan said he will not welcome the visiting dignitary. \"Welcoming Pakistans PM would be the insult of the martyrdom of our soldiers because Pakistan neither took action against guilty despite protest of our government nor return the head of our soldier so I boycotted his visit,\" the Dargah's spiritual head said yesterday. As per tradition, the Ajmer Sharif Dargah Diwan receives VVIPS when they arrive at the Dargah. Khan's boycott will be largely symbolic because he is seen as a ceremonial head. The Khadims, who control the 12th century shrine of Sufi Saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, escort visiting dignitaries and assist pilgrims at the dargah. General Ayub Khan, Gen Zia-ul-Haq, Nawaz Sharif, Benazir Bhutto, Pervez Musharraf and Asif Ali Zardari were among the previous Pakistani leaders to offer obeisance at the revered shrine in the past. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/nation\/2013\/mar\/09\/pakistan-pm-offers-prayers-at-ajmer-dargah-amid-protests-457076.html"}

And the saffron party’s warning, asking Didi ‘to set her house in order’,came at a massive rally staged as part of the ‘awareness programme’, which will continue till July 6, the death anniversary of Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mookherjee. “If the reign of terror and attacks against workers of Opposition parties continue, the Centre will take steps according to provisions of the Constitution. I want to remind Mamata that it is no more a government led by Manmohan Singh but it is our government headed by Narendra Modi,” BJP MP S S Ahluwalia said. Interestingly, the show of strength was a first for the BJP in West Bengal and it came in the wake of the party’s impressive showing in the Lok Sabha polls. And several youths took part in the rally, which gave further evidence of the deep inroads made by the party in the former CPM citadel, where it had increased its vote share substantially. Lauding Mookherjee’s pioneering efforts, which resulted in West Bengal attaining statehood, state BJP chief Rahul Sinha said,”I would like to remind Mamata that she would not have become Chief Minister had it not been for Mookherjee. There would have been no West Bengal as the entire state would have become part of East Pakistan(present-day Bangladesh).” Addressing the gathering, the state BJP leaders asked the party workers “not to get provoked by the TMC goons but to strengthen the organisation as the party’s goal was to capture power in the state in the 2016 Assembly elections”. According to them, with increasing number of workers from the other parties joining the BJP in West Bengal, it will be able to set in motion another “poribarton” (change) and offer a “rape-free and corruption-free West Bengal” to the people within two years. There has been a spike in the violence against the BJP cadre in the state by alleged TMC supporters, especially after the saffron party managed to get as much as 17 per cent of the vote in the general polls. And two BJP central teams, which visited Birbhum and South 24 Parganas districts to investigate the violent attacks on party cadre, had submitted its report to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/nation\/2014\/jun\/24\/BJP-Issues-Veiled-Threat-to-Didi-627935.html"}

On roads there was no sight of the ubiquitous vehicle wearing the shades of yellow and black. The roads were easy to motor along; there was no annoying black smoke making you feel nausea. Yes, the autorickshaws had gone off the City roads for a day long strike and for daily commuters, it was a hard day but for many others, it was a day free of pollution and road hazards. For there was no competition among the rivals for passengers and race to the destination which causes immense inconvenience to the people travelling in cars, bikes and even in the autorickshaws. The autorickshaw federation had given a call for the strike over the absence of parking lots and introduction of city bus service under the JNNURM. Thousands of daily commuters had to fend for themselves since the Capital is without a town bus service for last so many years and autorickshaws call the shots. Now that the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) is starting city bus service under JNNURM funding, it has come for resistance. The operators, who gheraoed the office of Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, said that they have been facing wrath of police over illegal parking although no such zones have been identified for them as yet. The City Bus Service which is slated to kick off from April also ca me in for criticism. The Capital City is set to get 50 buses under JNNURM. In fact, the city bus service is designed in such a manner that it would provide commuters regular transportation and in a cleaner environment. The autorickshaw association, however, has urged that the buses must operate between Bhubaneswar and its adjoining stations like Jatni and Khurda instead of running within City limits. They also demanded that prepaid autorickshaw service be started at railway station, bus stand and the city airport. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/odisha\/2010\/mar\/27\/a-day-sans-autos-142757.html"}

The Janapakshayatra, which aims at spreading the message of non-violence as one of the objectives, was arranged opposite to the GMPL School, Perinthalmanna, one of the venues of the arts festival. A group of around 15 Congress workers approached the stage where the LP section Arabic festival was taking place and asked the organisers to stop the fest because the voice from the stage was disturbing the programme of the KPCC president. Congress minister Aryadan Mohammed was addressing the crowd at that moment in the presence of V M Sudheeran. “They tried to enter the stage forcefully and tried to change the direction of the speakers. There were also efforts to attack a local cable channel cameraman. The festival was interrupted for almost one hour,” C Manoj Kumar, organising committee member of the fest, said. There was also allegation that some of the Congress workers, who came to interrupt the fest, were in an inebriated state. However, the Congress leadership has informed that there were no such issues at the arts festival venue. KPCC member and also the chairman of UDF committee in Perinthalmanna Sethumadhavan said that the party workers had only pointed out the disturbance they were facing because of the noise from the arts festival venue. Meanwhile, the police have registered a case against the Congress workers, based on a complaint filed by the school authorities. The party workers were also involved in a similar incident last Sunday when they manhandled a news channel cameraman while shooting the fighting of a few Congress workers outside the District Congress Committee office. V M Sudheeran took a major chunk of his time during the Yatra to condemn the CPM over the political violence its members were engaged in. But the attacks by Congress workers in Malappuram district have tarnished him and the yatra. Apart from this, the KPCC president was highlighting the need for women empowerment through the journey. But none of the women members had seats in the front the row when KPCC president convened a press meet on Thursday. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/kerala\/2014\/nov\/14\/Congress-Workers-Spoil-Sub-district-Arts-Fest-682260.html"}

The court will pronounce its order on sentence on Monday. “He (Shahzad) is held guilty of attempting to cause death of Head Constables Balwant Singh and Rajbir Singh and causing death of Inspector M C Sharma by firing on them,” Additional Sessions Judge Rajender Kumar Shastri said. “He is also found guilty of assaulting police officers and obstructing them from doing their duty,” he said. “Come for order on sentence on Monday (July 29),” the judge said after convicting him. The court found Shahzad guilty of murder, attempt to murder, obstructing and assaulting public servants and grievously injuring the police officers to deter them from performing their duty. The court, however, acquitted him of the offence under section 174A IPC (failure to appear in specified time and place as required by a proclamation by court). The encounter had taken place at flat no. L-18, Batla House in Jamia Nagar locality here on September 19, 2008, six days after serial bomb blasts rocked Delhi, killing 26 persons and injuring 133 others. The police had reached Batla House on a tip off that some suspected militants involved in the blasts were holed up in the building. Of the five flat occupants, Atif Ameen and Mohd Sajid were killed during the encounter. Highly-decorated Delhi Police Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma succumbed to the bullet injuries sustained during the gun battle while head constable Balwant was injured. Apart from these two, one Ariz Khan alias Junaid had been declared a proclaimed offender while Mohd Saif was not made an accused in this case as according to the prosecution, he had surrendered peacefully and did not play any part in the entire incident. The police team had recovered two .30 bore pistols and one A K series rifle with two loaded magazines, containing 30 live cartridges from the spot. Shahzad was arrested on January 1, 2010 from Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh. The court had on July 20 reserved the judgement after conclusion of final arguments by the police and the defence. During the trial, Shahzad had called as defence witnesses Saif and Zeeshan, both lodged in Sabarmati jail in Ahmedabad in connection with the serial blasts of July 26, 2008 there, claiming that he was not at the spot. The prosecution examined 70 witnesses, including six eye-witnesses who were part of the raiding team of the Delhi Police Special Cell. The police had said that it has sufficient circumstantial evidence and phone records to prove that Shahzad was present in the Jamia Nagar flat and was among those who had fired at the police team leading to the death of inspector Sharma. It had said that Shahzad, along with Junaid, had jumped off the balcony and fled after firing at the police team during the September 19, 2008 encounter. The counsel, appearing for Shahzad, however, had claimed that he was not present in the flat in which the shootout took place. The defence had claimed that as per ballistic reports, the bullets found in the slain police officer’s body matched with the gun seized from the spot and not from the weapon which was allegedly retrieved from Shahzad’s possession when he was arrested. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/nation\/2013\/jul\/25\/Batla-House-shootout-Shahzad-Ahmed-convicted-for-cops-murder-500412.html"}

Later, a delegation of vendors held a discussion with the DIG (North) Sanjay Kumar who assured them of taking up their cause with the district administration to resolve the issue. Reports said acting on direction of Sambalpur Superintendent of Police Prateek Mohanty, the Sambalpur Town police evicted all 56 vendors sitting on the roadside from Laxmi Talkies Chowk to Golebazar Chowk. As they display their wares on the road, the narrow road gets squeezed and it becomes a nightmare to negotiate traffic. To prevent frequent traffic snarls, Mohanty had issued their eviction which sparked off resentment among the vendors who have been demanding development of vending zones and their rehabilitation. Although the Municipality had agreed to develop vending zones after vendors along the roads were evicted two years back, the failure of the then Chairperson of Sambalpur Municipality Rina Trivedi to take the Councillors and the district administration into confidence stalled the project even after the work was outsourced. The administration protested to development of vending zones on government land while the Councillors cried foul on the deal to outsource. Since then, the vendors are at the crossroads till the issue cropped up again with the fresh eviction by the police. President of Sambalpur Utha Dokani Sangha Satish Bishi said even though a tripartite agreement was signed among the vendors, Municipality and the district administration to resolve the problems of the vendors and develop vending zones, no concrete step has been taken in this regard. Although the place for vending zone has been identified, the Municipality seems least interested to go ahead with the project, Bishi said. It was also agreed that till the vendors are not rehabilitated, they will continue to operate from their old places. But now 56 vendors have been evicted without any rehabilitation in place, he added. He said since they had opened their temporary shops by covering the drains along the road and were not obstructing traffic in any way, they should be allowed to operate till the vending zone is ready. Admitting that the vendors need to be rehabilitated, Sanjay Kumar said he would take up the issue with the district administration. Since unemployment may lead many vendors to anti-social activities, they should be rehabilitated, he added. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/odisha\/2013\/may\/10\/Evicted-vendors-stage-demo-475992.html"}

The civic body with skeletal staff is facing a mammoth task of clearing 550 metric tonnes of garbage on an average per day. They are able to clear even 60 per cent of the garbage a day and as the days pass, the garbage pile-up is only increasing and the situation is getting worse. Even as both the public and the civic officials want the strike to end, the agitating sanitation workers have decided to intensify their agitation, with no response from the government. Earlier in the day, the agitating sanitation workers took out a protest rally from Tummalapalli Kalakshetram to the Collector’s Camp Office, where they staged a dharna shouting anti-establishment slogans for a couple of hours. As there was no assurance from the government, they decided to stage a ‘rasta roko’ at the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) Office on Tuesday. On an average, the city generates 550 metric tonnes of garbage every day and this goes up on festive occasions. VMC employs around 3,500 people to clear the garbage, canals and drains. Among them, only some 800 are regular employees while the remaining 2800 are hired help (outsourced or contract employees). It has 10 dumping yards, three cargo vehicles, five 10-tyred vehicles and six small tippers,. It also hires six to seven tractors from time to time for transporting the slit taken out from the drains in the city. Several tricycles are employed for door-to-door garbage collection. The collected garbage is first taken to Excel Plant at Ajit Singh Nagar, before being transported to the dumping yard at Jakkampudi on the city outskirts. Three months back, when the garbage transport vehicle drivers went for a flash strike, the city stank for four days. VMC health department officials said though the situation was not alarming this time round as it was during the previous strike, the city could stink more if the antiation workers’ strike was not resolved fortwith. They said that people were worried that if it rained now, the garbage-filled streets could stink more and lead to te outbreak of various diseases. When contacted, VMC health department officials said they were making every effort to clear the garbage. Some 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the regular municipal workers were striving to clear the garbage. Special teams with 10-15 workers had been formed to act as emergency garbage clearing force, they added . VMC Commissioner G Veerapandiya appealed to the Vijayawada citizens to cooperate with the corporation in the present crisis and put the garbages from their houses and localities in the garbage dumps and not throw them on the roadside.

Over 1,000 protestors were arrested on the outskirts of Hyderabad and neighbouring Mahabubnagar district. Defying ban orders, Telangana supporters came out on the road at several places to enforce a 24-hour-long blockade to demand a separate Telengana state. The traffic between Kurnool and Hyderabad was badly hit in the morning. The police later cleared the highway by taking activists of various political parties and their leaders into custody. Normalcy was restored in the afternoon and the state-owned Andhra Pradsh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) resumed its bus services. Police arrested leaders of various political parties who squatted on the highway in response to 'Sadak Bandh' called by Telangana Joint Action Committee (JAC) to urge the central government to immediately carve out a Telangana state. JAC convenor M. Kodandaram, Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) legislators K. Tarakarama Rao, E. Rajender and Harishwar Reddy were among dozens of leaders arrested by the police for staging protests on the highway despite police not giving permission for the same. Tension prevailed at Alampur, Annaram and Jadcherla in Mahabubnagar district as protestors damaged few trucks and buses following the arrests of their leaders, police said. Those arrested include leaders of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The protestors came out on the highway with bullock carts to stop the vehicular traffic. Police had a tough time in controlling them as they squatted on the highway at several points. Students and lawyers also joined the protests, focusing on Mahabubnagar district to stop vehicles entering Telangana coming from Kurnool district, which is a part of the Rayalaseema region. Earlier, hundreds of vehicles were stranded at Alampur, about 160 km from Hyderabad, as, raising slogans of \"Jai Telangana\", the activists of JAC and TRS stopped the traffic. A senior police officer said 700 people have been arrested in Mahabubnagar district since Thursday morning. Over 6,000 policemen were deployed on the highway. Prohibitory orders banning assembly of five or more persons were also imposed. Mahabubnagar Superintendent of Police Nagender Kumar said 13 members of the state assembly and two members of council were among those arrested. He said action would be taken against those found involved in attacks on vehicles. JAC convenor Kodandaram condemned the arrests and said he and other leaders would continue their protests in various police stations. He accused the government of suppressing a peaceful and democratic protest to demand Telangana state. He claimed that the protest was successful. The TRS and BJP also staged road blockades at Shamshabad on the outskirts of Hyderabad. TRS leader Harish Rao and Swami Goud were among 400 people arrested by the police. The protestors, including women, cooked food and staged cultural programmes on the road. Police also arrested 400 BJP activists including senior leader Vidyasagar Rao at Shamshabad for staging a road blockade. At the Osmania University in Hyderabad, police stopped students trying to take out a rally in support of 'Sadak Bandh'. The leaders of BJP, CPI and main opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) raised the issue of arrests in the state assembly. url : http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/andhra-pradesh\/2013\/mar\/21\/hundreds-arrested-for-blocking-hyderabad-bangalore-highway-460765.html"}

The wall blocks 27th Main Road, a public road, the protesters claimed. People commuting to Hosur Road and Electronics City have to take a detour and go through the meandering narrow lanes of HSR Layout to get to the other side as the road, also called as High Tension Road, has been blocked by the apartment, they said. HSR Layout corporator Gurumurthy Reddy, who came to the spot, assured that an amicable solution will be worked out by August 15 and that the road will be freed. V Ramakrishna Reddy, president of Haralur-Somasundarapalya Residents’ Federation said, “Sobha may have the occupancy certificate but one needs to look into how they got it. According to rules, any layout that is spread over five acres should leave space for public utility. A 12-storey building should leave a 60-feet road as access road in front of it. They should at least provide us an alternate route. First, the Revenue Department needs to find out how village land was given for construction and probe how BDA and BBMP officers gave clearances.” Reddy claimed that, as per a land conversion order issued by the Deputy Commissioner, 21 guntas of government land was declared ‘B kharab’. As per regulations ‘B kharab’ land cannot be converted and should be used only for public purposes, he added. “As per the approved plan of the BDA, the area marked on either side of the wall are clearly marked as road under the high tension line. The Comprehensive Development Plan-2015 has clearly shown a 24-metre wide road under the HT line,” he said. M Subash, president of Sobha Daffodil Residents’ Association said, “If BDA is to blame, then it is for them to answer. We have all the documents indicating the legal occupancy of these flats.

A Bench comprising Justice Markandey Katju and Justice Gyan Sudha Mishra did not agree with the submissions of senior counsel L Nageshwar Rao and G Prakash, who appeared for the state government. Counsel told the Bench that the matter is related to various offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, but the Kerala High Court simply arrived at a finding saying it attracts Sections 201 and 202 of the Indian Penal Code. The High Court had erred in doing so and by granting bail, counsel stated.It was on July 4 that seven persons of the Popular Front of India intercepted the car of colege lecturer Joseph, who was then working at Newman College and chopped off his palm. In the ensuing attack, the victim's son attacked one of the assailants. This caused injury to accused no: 37 in the case. This accused no: 5 called up Dr Raneef to come to the house and suture the wound of accused no: 37. The state contended that Dr Raneef is a dentist, but treated this kind of a wound. Therefore, he was a part of the conspiracy and, hence, should not be granted bail.The High Court granted bail on the ground that he did not participate in the direct assault. The case of the prosecution is that Dr Raneef had prior knowledge about the occurrence and is also actively involved.However, Justice Katju brushed aside the argument of Nageshwar Rao and declined to interfere with the order of the High Court which granted bail to Dr Raneef on September 17. The Ernakulam Sessions Court on Monday granted bail to the first accused, Jaffer, and second accused, Asharaf, in the T J Joseph hand chopping case. Ernakulam Sessions Court judge V Shircy granted bail on a bond of Rs 1 lakh and two solvent sureties for the same amount.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and WhatsApp chief Jan Koum said in their conference call yesterday there would be no change to WhatsApp's operations worldwide. \"WhatsApp will continue to operate independently and autonomously,\" Koum said. Zuckerberg added: \"We'll find that there are different ways for the [two] organisations to work together, accelerate each other's growth, or to link over time, maybe, if we think of something, although that's not the plan upfront.\" That strategy means Facebook will still have no presence on the mainland, which had 1.23 billion mobile subscribers and 618 million internet users at the end of December. Facebook, which has 1.2 billion monthly active users worldwide and generated revenue of US$2.5 billion last year, has been blocked on the mainland since late 2009, after protests in Xinjiang turned into riots which authorities said were abetted by information carried on social media networks. The South China Morning Post reported in September that Facebook and other banned sites would be available in the Shanghai free-trade zone. WhatsApp, like other mobile-messaging apps such as Line and Viber, can be accessed on the mainland and is used to replace traditional text messaging. WhatsApp has about 450 million monthly users worldwide and more than 320 million daily active users. Internet company Tencent's WeChat service is the most-used mobile-messaging app on the mainland, with more than 270 million monthly active users. Dan Neary, Facebook's vice-president for Asia-Pacific operations, said the social network had engaged with companies on the mainland that wanted to market their products to consumers around the world.

{"url":"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/417332\/unrest-could-flare-amid-downturn-academic-says","text":"Unrest could flare amid downturn, academic says PUBLISHED : Monday, 02 June, 2003, 12:00am Advisory panel head predicts more layoffs and transport fare rises could spark disturbances but full-scale riots are unlikely Small-scale disturbances could break out if there is no sign of economic recovery in the next six months, a leading political scientist has warned. Kuan Hsin-chi, convenor of a panel on social cohesion under the government's Central Policy Unit, said he did not rule out brief and localised disturbances triggered by the possibility of large-scale layoffs and fee rises by public transport companies. His remarks come two weeks after the government announced that the unemployment rate for February to April rose to 7.8 per cent, matching a record high set in July last year. But the 13-member panel reached a consensus that full-scale riots like those which erupted in 1966 and 1967 were unlikely to take place. The 1966 riots, which were prompted by a 50 per cent increase in cross-harbour ferry fares, took place against the backdrop of a bad economy and widening gap between the government and the people. The 1967 riots, which were triggered by a labour dispute in San Po Kong, claimed 51 lives and briefly brought the city to a standstill. The riots were a spillover of the Cultural Revolution that was launched on the mainland one year earlier. Professor Kuan, also head of the department of government and public administration at Chinese University, told the South China Morning Post there was no possibility of large-scale disturbances as most residents saw social stability as their overriding concern. 'Hong Kong people are generally tolerant of social and economic hardship,' he said, 'Most people still have some assets at their disposal despite the economic doldrums of the past few years.' The professor added that there were no entrenched social and cultural divisions in Hong Kong, while political organisations and trade unions were not organised enough to mobilise the public to take part in violent protests. The panel, which was set up in August last year, will submit a report to the government in July or August. Professor Kuan said the present situation in Hong Kong was the most severe since the 1967 riots. 'For a society which has enjoyed a low jobless rate for nearly two decades, the present 7.8 per cent unemployment rate is quite high. 'If there are large-scale layoffs or fee rises by a public transport company, it would not be inconceivable to see thousands of people take to the streets, after some [sections of the] media stir up popular discontent.' Whether this kind of trouble would linger for more than two days would hinge on the extent of economic woes and people's frustration with the government. Professor Kuan said it was unfortunate that Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa had hit out at members of the democracy camp during a question-and-answer session in the legislature two weeks ago. 'It's high time for the government and pro-democracy camp to put aside their political differences to face the challenges ahead. In other countries, it is common for all political forces to unite together during crises,' the professor said. The professor said surveys conducted by the Chinese University's institute of Asia-Pacific studies in the past few years showed that political parties, including the pro-democracy and pro-Beijing camps, scored low in public trust. 'It may hinder the democratic development in Hong Kong,' he said. 'It would be difficult to persuade Beijing to agree to speed up the pace of democratisation even if the parties manage to reach a consensus.' The government plans to launch a public consultation for post-2007 constitutional development as early as next year. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/417332\/unrest-could-flare-amid-downturn-academic-says"}

The full video , which emerged on the internet on Saturday, is a series of edited clips allegedly showing Suqian’s Diche village party secretary Zhang Zaixian teaming up with thugs to physically bully villagers into complying with his demolition plans. The video allegedly shows the gang brutally roughing up locals and forcing a school owner to sign a consent letter for the demolition of a local private school. The clip was made by the school’s owner according to the video’s description. In the video he says that Zhang ordered over 200 thugs to illegally detain his school staff and demolish the school on August 10. “We are fighting [the local government] with blood everyday. Any righteous man please save us,” a subtitle of the video clip reads. The video clip, particularly a scene where several men are seen throwing an elderly man into a small pond and then forcing a young man’s head under the water, has sparked widespread outrage online. Many internet users have called for a thorough investigation into the claims made in the video. A district official of Suqian on Sunday denied the government’s involvement in the clash, calling it an economic dispute between the school owner and local villagers, Southern Metropolis Daily said on Monday. According to officials’ accounts, local teacher Li Shijin built the school in 2003 on a 11.6-acre land rented from villagers for an annual fee of 28000 yuan. They claimed that as the school closed down three years ago and the rental fee barely came to half its market price amid soaring land prices, villagers resorted to violence in their eagerness to retake the land. The elderly and two other individuals roughly treated in the video were the tenant’s family members, the official told the newspaper. He said they provoked a row after they tried to block a bulldozer operated by land owners to clean the demolished school’s ruins. Police said the violent confrontations did not result in serious injuries, but promised to further investigate the incident, the report said. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/china-insider\/article\/1297760\/jiangsu-authority-denies-forced-demolition-after-violent-video"}

Raymond Tam Chi-yuen, who on Tuesday was elected as a deputy to China’s legislature , the National People’s Congress, said that in terms of political atmosphere and timing, it was impossible for the government to reform the system for the chief executive election to allow universal suffrage in the 2022 poll. The former minister said that rather than trying to push a political reform package through the Legislative Council, it was more practical for officials to enact national security legislation after the legislature’s general election in 2020, as Beijing had already signalled its impatience at Hong Kong for making no progress on the matter. Tam, 53, was secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs from 2011 to June this year. In October 2013, Tam, along with Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who was then chief secretary, and justice secretary Rimsky Yuen Kwok-keung kicked off a two-year process aimed at achieving a popular ballot for the 2017 chief executive election. Fear and loathing: which way forward for Article 23 national security law in face of stiff opposition in Hong Kong? But Beijing handed down a stringent framework on the issue, triggering the 79-day Occupy protests in 2014, a year before the government’s electoral reform package was voted down in Legco. Speaking to the Post in an interview on Wednesday, Tam suggested it was likely the next chief executive poll in 2022 would again be decided by the 1,200-member Election Committee, a panel dominated by business elites, professionals and politicians. “It’s difficult for the government to start constitutional reform in the next two to three years,” he said. Tam explained that with ongoing court cases involving Occupy protesters and last year’s Mong Kok riot , it would be difficult to create “a suitable atmosphere” for debates on sensitive issues. Asked whether universal suffrage could be achieved by 2027, Tam said he believed that would depend on the “groundwork” laid by Lam’s government. “From going to the mainland for more exchanges to lining up Beijing officials [to engage] individual political parties behind the scenes, these all are the groundwork,” Tam said, adding that it was hard to tell whether the reform process could be relaunched until officials and lawmakers had sat down to talk. While President Xi Jinping is widely expected to lead China for at least five more years, the next leadership reshuffle in Beijing in March will see some state leaders, including Zhang Dejiang, currently the top official overseeing Hong Kong affairs, retiring. Tam said that with a new state leader taking over the role, he believed there would be opportunities for Beijing officials and pan-democrat lawmakers to meet for talks or mainland visits. While the pro-democracy camp is asking the Hong Kong government to introduce democratic reforms, the administration is also facing increasing pressure from Beijing to enact Article 23 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, which states that the city must establish its own law to protect national security. In light of the calls from the pro-Beijing camp, Tam believed that Lam could include national security legislation as one of her priorities in the latter half of her five-year term, which ends in 2022. “If I were her, I would also choose to kick-start [Basic Law] Article 23 legislation rather than constitutional reform,” Tam said. Pressure increases on Hong Kong leader to enact controversial national security law He said a good time to enact national security legislation would be after the Legco polls in 2020, as the newly elected lawmakers would be the ones to vote on the bill after a public consultation exercise. In April, shortly after Lam was elected chief executive, Tam famously hinted that he would leave the government, saying that “perhaps my pace and Lam’s were slightly different”. The remarks sparked speculation over whether Tam was implying a disagreement with the chief executive-elect. But Tam insisted in the interview with the Post that he was saying only that “it was normal for the paces of officials in the cabinet to be different”. Asked to compare the current and former governments, Tam said the paces of incumbent ministers “seemed more united and synchronised”. Tam is currently a senior executive of the New Frontier Group, a business collective founded by his former boss, Antony Leung Kam-chung. Tam was press secretary during Leung’s tenure as financial secretary from 2001 to 2003.

But instead of going to exotic locations, Mr Tung and his wife Betty were spotted staying at the Hong Kong Disneyland hotel. Not only did the Tungs' visit coincide with that of Disney ambassador and singer Jacky Cheung Hok-yau and his family, InvestHK chief Mike Rowse was also seen spending time with Mickey and Minnie, staying for four days from December 28. We can easily guess why Cheung or Mr Rowse - an avowed Disney fan - chose to spend Christmas week at Disneyland, but Mr Tung? Enjoying the fruits of his labour or helping boost visitor statistics? Alan Leong gets on his bike Despite the Civic Party's chief executive candidate Alan Leong Kah-kit appearing at the League of Social Democrats' bicycle protest, things weren't all lovey-dovey between the two groups. Mr Leong, who said he last cycled eight to 10 years ago, faced an embarrassing moment when League core member 'Long Hair' Leung Kwok-hung gave him a choice of riding on a bicycle or in a wheelchair. 'We're not cursing Mr Leong by saying he will be physically handicapped. We're just saying he is politically handicapped by the system,' Mr Leung said. Mr Leong chose the bike. Getting the message across Mr Leong has been rightly aggressive in his bid for the top job, with his policy platform and near-nonstop campaigning, even though there is little doubt Donald Tsang will be re-elected for a second term. But some might have accused Mr Leong of aiming too high with his New Year message, released yesterday. Speaking to shoppers in Sha Tin, the barrister said he saw room for a tax cut this year and hoped the government would lead Hong Kong people to ponder questions about the city's future direction. Not only did Mr Leong outdo Mr Tsang, who did not give a New Year message this year or last, but he put himself on a par with President Hu Jintao , who gave his New Year wishes to Hong Kong during Mr Tsang's duty visit last week. Generation card is played Veteran members of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong reiterated their wish yesterday to have 10,000 members by mid-2007 to coincide with the party's 15th anniversary. Constitutional affairs secretary Stephen Lam Sui-lung said he had absolute confidence this would be achieved. 'Before I came on stage, [former chairman] Tsang Yok-sing showed me a picture of his grandson. There, we already have a third-generation member,' he said. Not much choice on political affinities in the Tsang family then. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/577250\/political-animal"}

Organisers of Occupy Central, a civil disobedience movement calling for democratic elections by \"international standards\", gathered several thousand supporters outside the Hong Kong government headquarters in Tamar between 7pm and 9pm on Sunday. They declared Occupy Central would soon enter it next stage, calling for thousands of protesters to stage sit-ins on main roads and \"wave after wave\" of protests and paralyse Hong Kong's financial centre. Watch: Scholarism protest against NPC decision outside of Beijing official Li Fei's hotel 10.45pm About a hundred protesters led by student activist group Scholarism remain camped opposite the Grand Hyatt Hotel awaiting Li Fei's expected arrival at around 2am. Lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung and Scholarism convenor Joshua Wong Chi-fung give speeches to rally protesters, who are asked to rest and drink water during this period. 10.38pm At least 10 police vehicles are parked at a row of bus stops on Gloucester Road. Some people shouted angrily at the police for causing inconveniences to the public and parking with their engines on. 10.12pm After the chaotic scene, Scholarism announced that the police had agreed to expand the barricaded protesting zone.

One of the organisers shouted repeatedly via a loudspeaker, asking protesters not to engage in physical clashes with the police. The chaos lasted about 2 minutes. 9.15pm Speaking after the event, Benny Tai Yiu-ting said Sunday night's turnout of a few thousand exceeded his expectations. \"In such a short time, thousands showed up to express their disappointment at the NPC's decision,\" he said. Event organisers at 8pm estimated the turnout at 5,000. After the rally, police estimated that 2,640 people had joined at its peak time. \"Even though the decision is unjust and undemocratic, many people are willing to fight for democracy and for the ability to decide their own fate.\" Tai said he could not provide further details about when exactly the movement would commence but \"citizens would know when the time comes\". He said student boycotts would begin first, followed by a number of regular lawful protests. A yellow ribbon campaign would hopefully raise public awareness about the injustice of the NPC decision, he said. Watch: Occupy Central leaders promise civil disobedience campaign in Hong Kong 9.10pm Demonstration comes to an end. \"We will meet again very soon in Central,\" says Benny Tai Yiu-ting. Occupy organisers urge participants to leave in orderly and peaceful manner and not to engage with counter-protesters who could try to provoke them. 9.06pm Ng Yut-ming, 50, attended the rally with his wife and daughter. He said he was disappointed over the Standing Committee's decision. \"I want to tell Beijing that Hong Kong people do not agree with their decision and will not accept this,\" said Ng. He said he would participate in Occupy Central and was ready to accept potential legal consequences. Ng's daughter Long-hei, 21, said she had not decided if she would take part in the boycott of classes or Occupy Central, depending on if these activities would change Beijing's mind.

Many in the rally have opened umbrellas and stayed in the venue, as speakers on the stage vowed \"wave after wave of fight\" for real democracy. \"Hope starts with people,\" one speaker shouts, with many in the audience echoing him. Later, Scholarism spokeswoman Agnes Chow Ting announced the group's plan to \"ambush\" Li Fei, chairman of the Basic Law Committee, at his hotel in Wan Chai after the rally. 7.35pm Amid a slight drizzle, Civil Human Rights Front convenor Johnson Yeung Ching-yin takes to the stage. Yeung says the central government had made two mistakes. The first was to lie to Hong Kong for 30 years, the second was to attempt \"to kill Hong Kong's democracy\". He urges protesters to each look for a friend or companion to join them in the Occupy Central movement. Federation of Students secretary-general Alex Chow Yong-kang breaks into tears as he speaks. \"Hong Kong is the home court of Hongkongers!\" he shouts. 7.35pm Seven police vehicles are parked in front of the City Hall, all with engine running. 7.25pm Groups of police officers are scattered along roads between Admiralty and Central. In the pictures, officers getting ready near City Hall. 7.20pm Occupy leader Benny Tai Yiu-ting said the city would now officially enter an \"era of civil disobedience\". \"I know many people are here our of frustration. But we should not. Why? It's because we see hope,\" said Tai. \"Look at the person sitting next to you. That person will be occupying Central with you! \"We see injustice in society ... And we must voice out this unjust! He did not give an exact date on when the actual date would take place due to legal concerns but urged participants to pay attention in the next week or two. He said the movement would dovetail with the student boycotts and come in \"wave after wave\" of protest. 7.10pm Metal barricades are seen tied to roadside fences in several different places in Admiralty and Central. Police have previously said they would install at least 3,000 metal barricades along Chater Road, Queen's Road Central and Des Voeux Road Central. More police vans are seen parked on small streets such as Club Street, where another six police vehicles are seen. 7.10pm Throngs of people begin flowing into Tamar Park from Admiralty Centre. Occupy Central organisers kick off the evening's events on stage. Occupy co-organiser said the NPC's decision for electing the chief executive in 2017 did not meet international standards. Twenty-five pan-democratic lawmakers took to the stage saying they would veto the plan in council and called for unity. They said the central government had deprived the Hong Kong public's right to choose by not including civic nomination. 6.55pm Small splinter protest groups rally outside the Chief Executive's Office. About 30 to 40 protesters waving national and Hong Kong flags chanted their support for the NPC'a decision and opposition the Occupy Central. Another group waving colonial-era flags protested across the street. No clashes were seen. A large presence of police kept the two side apart. 6.45pm Chater Road and Chater garden are relatively unguarded, occupied mostly by foreign domestic helpers. The centre of the open area under the HSBC headquarters has been barricaded, with some construction work apparently going on. The area has been a popular gathering place among domestic helpers and protesters in the last few years. Six police vans are parked on both sides of the small Bank Street between the HSBC headquarters and the Bank of China building, likely waiting to be dispatched. 6.15pm Police presence near government headquarters in Tamar becomes more palpable, with about 30 uniformed officers seen on one of the footbridges leading to the government buildings.

Speaking at the end of the handover anniversary celebrations yesterday, Mr Ho said if the allegations proved true, the officers involved would be punished. A number of demonstrators and Falun Gong members claim they were injured by police. Among them, mother-of-three Kelly Kong Xo, 42, from Sydney, said she was beaten by a uniformed officer as she tried to enter Macau for the anniversary celebrations. She was treated in hospital in Hong Kong after being ejected along with dozens of other activists and Falun Gong members ahead of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's arrival on Tuesday. But Mr Ho insisted: 'We don't allow the police to apply excessive force.' He said that 'by and large' the police did their job 'within the law'. His Government would 'not allow any activities that disturb social stability and public security'. The approach towards handling matters of public security was in accordance with the Macau Basic Law. On Wednesday, Mr Jiang urged Macau to take concrete measures to crack down on anti-Beijing activities. Mr Ho said Mr Jiang had told him during his stay that he regretted tight security prevented him from making close contact with people. 'He told me he didn't like it, but even the President has to submit himself to the measures, even he has to obey the tight security arrangements,' the Chief Executive said. Mr Ho, who assumed the helm of Macau's administration on December 20 last year, admitted many people had not been given the opportunity to meet Mr Jiang because of the strict security. The 45-year-old Chief Executive said he was grateful for the President's 'compliments' about the achievements of the Macau Special Administrative Region in its first year of existence, adding his Government was receiving 'pressure from all areas, pressure that we haven't done enough'. He said his administration would continue to follow the policy guidelines of 'consolidating the foundations and steady development'. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/334918\/macau-police-brutality-claim-be-investigated"}

The Travel Industry Council will discuss the proposal when it meets on Tuesday. It will also discuss doubling from 14 days to a month the period during which travellers are guaranteed a full refund in the event they are not satisfied with goods they have bought. Meanwhile, the Consumer Council is urging the government to plug legal loopholes to offer better protection to consumers, with a view to enacting a consumer protection law in the long term. The actions by the two agencies come two weeks after a report by national broadcaster CCTV about Hong Kong shops selling fake goods to mainland visitors. The report led several mainland visitors to return to the city to seek refunds, with one filing a complaint to the Consumer Council. Customs officers have raided several shops, seizing hundreds of watches from one in To Kwa Wan, and police have made 13 arrests. On Commercial Radio programme Forum yesterday, the executive director of Travel Industry Council, Joseph Tung Yao-chung, said its proposals aimed to deal with unscrupulous shops that registered with the council under a new name after being blacklisted. 'If the new shop has the same address as that of the one previously blacklisted, we will instruct our member agencies that within one year they should not take tourists to that shop to buy things,' he said. Proprosal details were expected to be worked out by the middle of next month, he added. At present, 50 shops are registered with the council. The newly appointed chief executive of the Consumer Council, Connie Lau Ying-hing, said extra staff would be deployed to help tourists during the Labour Day 'golden week' holiday next month. She said that in the long run, there was a need for comprehensive legislation to cover commercial transactions.

Gandhi's groaning in his grave | South China Morning Post Deliberation day? Gandhi's groaning in his grave Our bosses up in Beijing must be laughing at us. We have shown them what a bunch of idiots we Hongkongers are. They did not need to use divide and rule tactics; we have divided ourselves. Now they can rule us with far greater ease. We have spent decades demanding democracy, but we destroyed it all in one so-called \"deliberation day\". The pan-democratic camp is now in tatters, divided and speaking with so many different voices that it is starting to sound like mumbo jumbo. Our democracy crusaders have obviously never heard of the old adage, \"United we stand\". Last week's deliberation day by the Occupy Central movement to decide on a democracy model to put to the people in an unofficial referendum next month was nothing short of a joke. Only about 2,500 hard-core Occupy supporters voted. They unsurprisingly chose the three most radical models, proposed by two extreme political groups and one student group, whose plan had the most votes. The people of Hong Kong will be asked to choose from these three proposals only. Has the Occupy movement so lost its marbles that it wants kids still in school to dictate our democratic path? Gandhi must be groaning in his grave that the movement has based its credibility on the use of civil disobedience, which he pioneered. None of the three proposals has a hope in hell of getting the nod from the central government so why waste time with a referendum? Is the movement telling us it will occupy Central after Beijing rejects the referendum outcome even when its winning proposal is one of three radical models chosen by 2,500 people? Moderates wouldn't know what to do with democracy Moderates in the democracy movement are howling. Their movement has been hijacked by the radicals, but instead of forming a swat team to regain control, they are flailing their arms not knowing what to do. God help us if we ever get democracy. These self-styled champions of democracy do not even know how to fight for it. What will happen if it is put in their hands? Thailand, maybe? Jackie Chan was probably right when he said Chinese people would not know what to do with democracy and that they needed to be controlled. Monkey business at the MTR Corporation Even monkeys can be taught tricks, so why can't the MTR Corporation? It is clear that the people are baying for blood. They feel they have been taken for a ride by the MTR. A HK$67 billion high-speed railway is delayed for two years. When an MTR cover-up did not work, it blamed rain for destroying a tunnelling machine. When the people did not buy that, it blamed difficult tunnelling conditions. When the people wanted heads to roll, MTR Corp chairman Raymond Chien Kuo-fung announced chief executive Jay Walder's contract would not be renewed when it expired next year. Why didn't Chien just leave it at that? People would have thought they got their blood. But no, he chose to slap the people in the face, by insisting Walder's departure had nothing to do with the scandal over the delay. He said Walder had decided last year to leave after his contract ran out, but that the MTR had chosen not to tell us because it was none of our business even though the public owns more than 70 per cent of the railway. In other words, the people will not get their blood, because Walder is not being pushed; he just decided to jump. That slap in the face has increased pressure on the MTR to cut short Walder's contract. When will the MTR learn? Maybe spending time with monkeys would help.

A liberal in the Communist Party, Hu was forced to resign as general party secretary in 1987 and remains a sensitive figure in mainland politics. The outpouring of grief following his death in 1989 developed into the Tiananmen Square student movement in the ensuing months. In the run-up to the party's once-a-decade changing of the guard in autumn, liberals have revived Hu's words as they try to relaunch reforms seen as having stalled in recent years. The China News Service report described the scene at Hu's mausoleum in Gongqing, Jiangxi province, in recent days. 'We come here every year,' the agency quoted Zhuo Yuhuan as saying. 'Now, as parents, we bring our child. We want our children to think of Hu Yaobang as the backbone of China.' Another mourner, a former state-owned-company official from Nanchang, said: 'Hu Yaobang honoured his idea of the people's welfare from his days of revolution to his days as state leader. That's why we come to pay our respects.' In his official obituary, Hu is described as a staunch communist, a great proletarian revolutionary and statesman, and an outstanding political leader of the People's Liberation Army. Yet it is rare to see any mention of Hu in official media as his death is associated with the Tiananmen protests in 1989, another taboo topic. Zhang Ming, a politics professor at Renmin University, said the article signalled to party leadership to take a more liberal approach and push forward reform: 'It is a good sign. I don't know when and how they are going to make reforms, but I think the leadership are considering it by sending such signals. Hopes are high for the new leadership.' But Liu Yanning of the Institute of Chinese Culture said: 'That's what people want to see but I don't think the agency has sent any important political signals in the past. It's probably just a decision at the agency.' President Hu Jintao ordered an official commemoration event for the 90th anniversary of Hu's birth in 2005.

Li Qihua, 81, who holds the rank of lieutenant-general in the PLA, was chief of the 301 Hospital in west Beijing until his retirement in 1984. Deng Xiaoping died at the hospital in February 1997. In an interview with General Li, Liberation Army Daily did not refer to his rank or former position, only calling him a 'veteran cadre' who had joined the revolution as a nine-year-old and had taken part in the Long March. He is the highest-ranking member of the Communist Party to declare his membership of Falun Gong. In the interview, he said that he knew nothing of the organisation before 1993. 'My wife fell ill. On the advice of other people, I started to try Falun Gong with her. Because of my high position, people encouraged and helped me to write an article which mistakenly promoted Falun Gong.' Sources said that General Li was one of the leaders of Falun Gong in Beijing, with his excellent connections in the military and Government making him a perfect ambassador for the group. They said the article he wrote came to the attention of the leadership after 10,000 Falun Gong members protested at Zhongnanhai, home of China's top leaders, on April 25. The article was read by General Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, who was stunned to see a senior member of the party and the military praising Falun Gong. General Zhang wrote a memo and sent a copy to party chief and President Jiang Zemin, also the chairman of the commission, and another to Defence Minister Chi Haotian. Senior officials were sent to see him. General Li said he had not been clear about the organisation and activities of Falun Gong and had not taken part in any of their collective activities. 'At the end of April, I was resting in Xian and heard that Falun Gong had organised people to make trouble at Zhongnanhai. I was shocked and angry. When I returned to Beijing, leaders from many ranks talked to me. I made a study of the important speech of Jiang Zemin and was educated.'

A fourth defendant, a pregnant woman, was given a life sentence, the city's intermediate people's court said on its weibo account. Iskandar Ehet, Turgun Tohtunyaz and Hasayn Muhammad were found guilty of \"organising and leading a terrorist group\" and intentional homicide after the one-day trial. Patigul Tohti, who was wounded and captured at the scene, was jailed for life after being convicted of taking part in the attack. She was given a more lenient sentence because it emerged she was pregnant while in detention, the court said. The ethnicity of the suspects was not given, but authorities said translators were present at the trial \"to protect the rights of the defendants\". According to the court, the group was influenced by religious fundamentalism and began to meet in December for physical training. Tohtunyaz helped them to acquire more than 10 knives used in the attack. They continued to meet in February at a hair salon in Gejiu, near Kunming, and plot their strategy, it said. Two days before the attack, local police arrested Tohtunyaz, Ehet and Muhammad as they tried to illegally cross into Vietnam via Honghe county, the court said. They did not confess to the planned attack after their capture, and so should bear full responsibility for the loss of life, the court said. Despite losing contact with the three men, five other members of the group went ahead with the attack. Police shot dead four of them, and captured the fifth, Tohti, after she was wounded. Initial reports by a variety of media, some quoting witnesses, said eight people brandished knives in the Saturday, March 1 attack. But the court account places only five assailants at the scene. Police announced on the Monday after the attack that three suspects had been taken into custody, which now appears to be a reference to the trio detained on February 27. At least five more people will be tried over the attack, Xinhua has reported. More than 300 people, including victims and their relatives, attended the trial. The government has blamed separatist forces from Xinjiang for the attack. Uygur activists say the government's high-handed policies fuel discrimination against them by the Han. Mainland authorities have launched a massive crackdown against terrorism in wake of a string of violent attacks in the restive Xinjiang region and other cities on the mainland. In June, courts around Xinjiang sentenced nine people to death in a mass trial of 81 terror suspects, state media reported.

Mr Leung sought the review in an unsuccessful attempt to be allowed to take his own version of the oath of office in the legislature. Mr Justice Michael Hartmann ruled that Mr Leung, also known as 'Long Hair' had no obligation to pay the legal costs of the Legislative Council secretariat, which opposed Mr Leung's application, but would have to meet his own costs. Mr Leung did not hire a lawyer. 'I am satisfied that the applicant [Mr Leung] did seek to bring a public interest challenge in its proper sense,' Mr Justice Hartmann said. The judge said the issue of whether guiding political, religious or philosophical principles could be incorporated into a Legco member's oath of office had not been firmly settled by the courts. 'In the broader public interest as he saw it, the applicant sought guidance from this court and did so altruistically without any intention of undermining the court's process,' Mr Justice Hartmann said. The Legco secretariat applied to the court for the legislator to pay its legal costs after Mr Justice Hartmann last week rejected Mr Leung's application for a judicial review. Mr Leung told the judge last Wednesday he could only pay $1 in court costs. He took the official oath hours after his application was rejected, but shouted slogans beforehand to demand vindication for those killed in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, and an end to one-party rule on the mainland. Mr Leung described the judge's verdict as 'righteous', adding that it was shameful for the secretariat to have applied for costs. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/474110\/long-hair-need-not-pay-costs-judge-says"}

The motion was passed at a meeting of the Legislative Council's housing panel discussing the government's new rent-and-buy scheme, My Home Purchase Plan. Many lawmakers questioned the government's refusal to relaunch the HOS to help people squeezed out of the private property market but unable to qualify for a government rental flat. 'You can find all the advantages of the MHPP in the HOS, and the HOS is even better,' Democrat legislator Fred Li Wah-ming said. 'Why do you ... not [run] both of them at the same time?' Leung Yiu-chung said there were both consent and demand in society for resuming construction of HOS flats. Secretary for Housing Eva Cheng argued that there were about 300,000 second-hand HOS flats that offered another option to the sandwich class. Members of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood demonstrated outside the Legco building before the meeting to urge resumption of the HOS. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/729210\/legislators-back-home-ownership-scheme"}

Resolving urgent issues such as national education, affordable homes for Hong Kong people, and coping with large flows of mainland tourists require his staying in the city at this time to ensure the right solutions are found and implemented. On the national education issue, Anna Wu Hung-yuk, chairwoman of the Committee on the Implementation of Moral and National Education, has said that the committee \"will be free to recommend any suggestions after thorough discussion\" (\"Committee will consider all options, chairwoman says\", September 6). Then it was reported that Mr Leung had \"scrapped the three-year deadline for implementation and announced schools will be free to choose independently whether to teach the subject\" (\"Leung's 11th hour U-turn on education\", September 9). He promised \"not to push for compulsory lessons while in office\" The Hong Kong Civic Association was established in 1954 as a citizens' political concern group on matters including education. We wish to urge the National Education Parents' Concern Group, the Scholarism group and the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union to maintain a dialogue with the chief executive and with Ms Wu. They should discuss and work together to find the way forward for the sake of Hong Kong's primary and secondary school population and their concerned parents. One of our association's core values is the willingness to engage in dialogue to arrive at solutions to community problems. This core value has sustained our faith in advocating and pushing for progressive change to enrich the lives of Hong Kong people. We commend it to these three education concern groups as well as to the student leaders of the citywide university class boycott just held. Hilton Cheong-Leen, president, Frederick Lynn, chairman, Hong Kong Civic Association Forum would have made more sense As an educator, I'm sorry to see that 8,000 tertiary students and teachers decided to boycott classes on Tuesday to demand the scrapping of the national education curriculum. They did this even after the government had relented and made the subject optional rather than compulsory, and even though it is a question of how the subject is taught and not the subject itself. The protesters would have made more sense - and done something for education rather than against it - if they had held a forum on how to educate our younger generation to be enlightened, responsible citizens. I'm reminded of the saying \"Education makes a people easy to lead but difficult to drive, easy to govern but impossible to enslave\". The protesters (and many others in Hong Kong) have proved the part (\"difficult to drive\" and \"impossible to enslave\"), but when will they learn to be \"easy to lead\" and \"govern\", which requires enlightenment, reasonableness, and a sense of objectivity and balance, not just emotions and inflammatory rhetoric? Tony Hung, Ma On Shan Why would we all want to think alike? In his column (\"The echo chamber that is public opinion\", September 12) Alex Lo approvingly cites Walter Lippmann's quip that, \"Where all think alike, no one thinks very much\". And this is precisely the point against national education. Who would wish to live in a community where we all think alike, where critical thinking is discouraged, where young people are told what to think? Agreed, there's no place for character assassination or threats, and nuanced debate and reflection are always welcomed. Ultimately, this controversy is about values and ideas. In this connection, I would not say the fight against national education has been won. The students did a truly impressive job but ultimately succumbed to exhaustion and arm-twisting. \"Turning the decision over to schools\" will surely be an effective way for the government to promote compliance through clientelism and other means. The government now claims the issue is in the past. Time will tell. In the meantime, please explain why it is \"dogmatic\" to call a curriculum that whitewashes history brainwashing? It is what it is. Jonathan D. London, Ngau Chi Wan A waste of time and resources The aim of implementing moral and national education was to strengthen students' national identity and nurture patriotism. However, protesters saw the new subject as a form of brainwashing. I believe it is not necessary to introduce this course into the school curriculum. Most Hong Kong schools already have Chinese language, Chinese history, liberal studies and classes which focus on morals and ethics. Students are already able to learn about the history of China, but also about current affairs in the country. National education just leads to repetition. Teachers and pupils complain about the heavy workload they face. National education would mean one more subject and would lead to increased pressure. It is clearly a waste of time and resources. Cheung Man-wa, Yau Yat Chuen Local workers don't have expats' perks I pity Hong Kong's poor expatriates for receiving the \"lowest\" actual salaries despite having the fourth-highest pay packages in Asia (\"Hong Kong's expats suffer as wages squeezed\", September 7). According to a survey, the high cost of education and housing in Hong Kong means they get the \"worst deal\" in the region. But what about us ordinary local workers who do not have the benefit of housing, entertainment, transport and housing allowances, and have to rely solely on our overstretched wages to provide for our families? Should we also now think of \"relocating to Singapore?\" Ruel F. Trinidad, Hung Hom Rationale for movement of staff puzzling An HR consultancy warns that wages for expatriates in Hong Kong are falling, and actually falling behind wages in other cities such as Singapore (\"Hong Kong's expats suffer as wages squeezed\", September 7). It also warns that companies may move expats from Hong Kong to Singapore for that reason. Expats are mobile of course, that's the nature of the beast. While I understand them finding a new job and moving to, say, Singapore because of the bad air in Hong Kong, I don't understand the rationale behind companies moving their expats to another city. And why to expensive Singapore, not to the mainland, where the company can save lots of costs on living expenses? Companies must have their reasons to pay over-the-top packages to incite people to move halfway across the world, and if they need these people in Hong Kong, they will station them in this city and not in Singapore. These companies will also pay pretty much whatever it takes to get the staff they need to move, and that may include hardship allowances to overcome the bad air. If it is so easy to move your expat staff from one city to another, then it seems it's not that important where this staff member is, so why not keep such people in their home country at half the cost? Wouter van Marle, Tai Po Prospective homebuyers bewildered The law which stipulates that property developers should use saleable instead of gross floor area of a new flat as the basis for quoting prices and sizes should be extended to cover the secondary market. There is no set standard for property agencies and this leaves prospective buyers bewildered. Some will use gross floor area while others might opt for saleable area. Some developers do not even state which type of standard they are adopting. As a result, confusion reigns. Thus, a clear and specific area calculating standard must be defined, regardless of whether it is the new or secondary home market, in order to increase transparency. The differences between gross floor and saleable area of a flat can be huge, with the actual usable area of a flat being much lower than is stated. This means the rights of consumers are not being protected. Many people in the secondary market are from the middle class or \"sandwich class\". If they are quoted the saleable area, they will know exactly what they are getting for their investment and this can avoid arguments. I would also like to see the law extended to commercial and industrial buildings and even shops in shopping malls.

{"url":"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/magazines\/hk-magazine\/article\/2029615\/forgotten-place","text":"PUBLISHED : Thursday, 19 November, 2009, 4:00pm The Forgotten Place | South China Morning Post What Do I Need to Know to Survive in Hong Kong? 19 Oct 2016 As controversial as it was, chief executive Donald Tsang’s policy address last month did actually present a novel plan that may bear fruit—his plan to conserve Central district as a whole is a break from the usual government actions to conserve only particular buildings and structures, and an idea activists have been promoting for a long time. The idea is that because Central as a whole has a significant historical status to Hong Kong, the whole district should be preserved, with special attention to its “unique historical and cultural features,” according to Tsang’s statement. The proposal is to conserve a cluster of buildings including Murray Building, two of three government headquarters buildings, Central Market and the Legco building. Conservationists have applauded the move, believing the government is finally taking the right step toward trying to preserve the very little there is left of our city that actually bears testimony to our history. Tsang’s plan, however, has one major flaw—while the conservation area he proposed extends as far south and west of Central as the Hollywood Road Police Quarters, he has put almost no emphasis on a very important venue from our history—Edinburgh Place. Sandwiched between City Hall and the former site of the already removed Queen’s Pier, the square has important links to the already demolished Star Ferry Pier. And because of that, a concern group called Heritage Watch is proposing to the government that the square, along with City Hall (a Grade I historical building) and the removed Queen’s Pier (also another Grade I historical building, which they are requesting be returned to its original location) should be viewed as an historical cluster and receive a grading by the government’s Antiquities and Monuments Office. Paul Zimmerman, founding member of Designing Hong Kong, says Edinburgh Place is a particularly important historical landscape that is often overlooked. Heritage Watch’s Miranda May Szeto, who is a professor in comparative literature at the University of Hong Kong, agrees. “This particular area reflects our history from the 1950s to 60s, especially developments in the social movements of the city,” she says. Edinburgh Place, after all, is perhaps best-known as the place where British governors first arrived in Hong Kong back in the colonial days (they would first arrive by boat at Queen’s Pier). When Queen Elizabeth II visited Hong Kong in 1986, her first steps into Hong Kong were at that very same place. “Edinburgh Place was designed to be a ceremonial venue,” Zimmerman explains. Its significance to British colonial government also made it an important location for protests and demonstrations, the most significant of which was the hunger strike against the Star Ferry fare hike of 1966, and also the campaign to protect the sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands by patriotic students back in 1971. Despite its significance, Edinburgh Place still has not received much attention from the government since the handover conservation-wise, particularly in Tsang’s latest policy address. However, Zimmerman says Tsang should not be blamed. “Hong Kong has been too focused on Queen’s Pier,” he says. “The piazza clearly is more significant than the pier but all the protests have solely been about Queen’s Pier.” He explains that their proposal this time aims to shift that focus back to where it matters. He also stresses that the area should be seen as a whole. “The architect who designed Edinburgh Place deliberately aligned the entrance of City Hall up with that of Queen’s Pier,” he says. “That is an important architectural feature we have to pay attention to, that preserving one building but not the other would just make no sense.” The plan to conserve Edinburgh Place, he says, should include a plan to relocate Queen’s Pier to its original location. Secretary of Development Carrie Lam announced earlier that the government has decided to relocate the original structure of Queen’s Pier to between Pier 9 and 10 instead of its original location. Zimmerman says relocating it in its original position only costs $30 million, while Lam’s plan would cost $220 million. Conservation architect Dr. Hoyin Lee, who is the director of the Architectural Conversation Programme at the University of Hong Kong, welcomes the proposal. He says Hong Kong needs to understand that resources put into heritage conservation should not be object-oriented. “We are used to grading buildings and conserving them,” he says. “But functional space and also the cultural landscape should receive recognition. I think [the proposal] would help the public to understand that heritage is beyond just physical objects.” However, Dr. Lee worries that the proposed grading would not mean much. “A Grade I grading doesn’t give much protection to the heritage spot,” he says. “Only if the space is zoned properly will the whole area retain its original vibe.” Conserving Central Chief executive Donald Tsang announced in his policy address last month that the government would conserve the Central district to retain its historical significance. The proposal is to conserve a cluster of buildings including Murray Building, two of three government headquarters buildings, Central Market, the Legco building and the former Hollywood Road Police Quarters. However, no measures at all have been revealed on how exactly to do so. Dr. Hoyin Lee, director of the Architectural Conversation Programme at University of Hong Kong, says using the traditional ways of controlling development in the district to maintain its environment (including maintaining the density of buildings and restricting development in the area) would be very difficult to enact with this plan because of strong pressure and resistance from property developers. However, if the government could introduce the creative industries as the main tenants of the conserved Central, there is a chance that this could be achieved. “Conserving the hardware, meaning the buildings, would not result in much,” he says. “Instead, they would have to quickly get the creative industries involved, get them to move their offices there, with the help of smaller property developers, because these are the people who care more about the environment they are in.” He listed the example of renovated tong laus in Central, where small property developers bought a tong lau to refurbish it for a different use. “They are all good examples on how to conserve buildings in areas like this to minimize the change to the urban fabric,” he says. “If they adopt this in Central, it will also serve as a catalyst for the rest of the city.” You may also like url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/magazines\/hk-magazine\/article\/2029615\/forgotten-place"}

Ignoring warnings that any gathering would be illegal, they started congregating near the provincial government headquarters at about 10am despite a heavy police presence. They dispersed only after the city's mayor talked to them. At least one demonstrator was briefly detained when he unfolded a banner, witnesses said. It was the second demonstration in Kunming about the controversial project this month, after more than 1,000 protesters took part in a rally on May 4. One protester said yesterday's turnout was smaller, following reports the authorities had tried to prevent the demonstration. The protesters called for the cancellation of the refinery project, about 30 kilometres away in Anning , which is owned by the China National Petroleum Corporation. The project received the final go-ahead from the central government in March and will have an annual refining capacity of 10 million tonnes. The protesters also expressed their opposition to a plan to produce the carcinogenic paraxylene (PX), a downstream product of the refinery. They began to march at around 2pm, attracting onlookers and passers-by as they moved towards a popular shopping and entertainment area under close police watch. They were eventually guided into a road with less traffic, where they were greeted by Kunming mayor Li Wenrong . Li started with a bow to the protesters, apologising for failing to communicate adequately, before taking questions from protesters. They asked why the police had been asking people \"for tea\" - a euphemism for questioning - simply because they had expressed their opposition to the project online. One questioned the credibility of government environmental reviews and asked Li how Kunming could possibly challenge powerful state-owned enterprises. Li vowed to improve government transparency and to listen to the public. He also promised to open a microblog account by noon today. He repeated that whether the PX project went ahead would depend on public opinion, but rejected a proposal from the protesters for a referendum of the city's seven million residents. \"There is no precedent for one person, one vote, being practised in our country, so it is not likely to happen,\" he said. Li also evaded most questions about the fate of the refinery, frustrating some protesters who left in the middle of the meeting. Instead, he offered face-to-face dialogue with protesters next Wednesday. Only eight people signed up. One of them, a 24-year-old, said: \"I hope this can be a good beginning for a dialogue between citizens and the government on major decisions.\" The rallies are seen as a sign of growing public awareness of environmental issues on the mainland and increasing courage in speaking out. The protesters fear the massive project's huge water consumption will worsen a water scarcity crisis in Kunming and pollute the city's skies. Kunming authorities have tried to assure them it would have only a limited impact on the environment and vowed tight supervision. But they said an environmental review of the project could not be published because it \"involves secrets\". One protester asked: \"If the refinery is as clean and safe as they claim it to be, why does the government not dare to publish the environmental review report?\" Inkstone: China News Briefing url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/china\/article\/1239338\/hundreds-join-second-protest-kunming-over-oil-refinery"}
{"url":"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/292289\/press-must-do-better","text":"The press must do better than this PUBLISHED : Tuesday, 31 August, 1999, 12:00am Everybody knows public opinion wavers. But few would have expected the magnitude of this latest swing. People were rallying for freedom of the press in the run-up to 1997. Now a majority is demanding freedom from the press. Various surveys have placed between 53 to 60 per cent of residents in favour of the Law Reform Commission's call for a 'Press Council for the Protection of Privacy' to investigate and rule on complaints against media intrusion. While the three pro-Beijing papers have assumed an ambiguous position, others in the industry are virtually unanimous in rejecting the proposal. The last time the journalism profession showed such solidarity was in the mid-1980s, when the Government pushed ahead with legislation against the propagation of so-called false news inciting public alarm. Conspiracy theories abound. The commission was first asked to look into the matter of privacy protection in October 1989. Yet, the panel's current reports have been discredited as the SAR Government's official attempt to tamper with the free operation of the media. There is no conceivable reason why the Chief Executive, already bogged down by a range of social conflicts, would want to declare war against the entire press at this critical juncture. In fact, there is a more direct way to do so, should the administration really want to tighten press control. Article 23 of the Basic Law, which requires the local authorities to legislate against crimes against the state, is always in the ready in the government arsenal. Meanwhile, some market leaders responded to the crisis with typical sensationalism. The Apple Daily, for instance, carried an editorial last weekend with the 1967 photograph of a naked, fleeing Vietnamese girl. The caption says, 'according to the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper on privacy, this kind of photo should neither be taken nor published'. Yet, the commission makes it clear in its report on Civil Liability for Invasion of Privacy that 'legitimate concern to the public' can be a defence. It lists six categories of circumstances that should constitute 'legitimate public concern'. The picture was arguably the most powerful image that helped shift US sentiments against the Vietnam campaign. Any reasonable person would have admitted it as a proper cause of legitimate public concern. Others pointed to the grim prospect of the media being prohibited from exposing misconduct of civil servants and public office bearers. Yet, 'the prevention or preclusion of unlawful or seriously improper conduct, public dishonesty or serious malpractice' is again listed as a valid defence. Sensationalism built on distorted facts to discredit the consultation papers will only reinforce public cynicism against the fourth estate. Talk show host Wong Yuk-man yesterday pledged on air to stage a sleep-in protest outside the Government Headquarters, if the authorities insist on establishing the controversial Media Council high-handedly. He cited Thomas Jefferson's legendary letter in 1787 which stated: 'were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter'. What Mr Wong failed to mention was Jefferson's abrupt change of mind, after he was elected the third US president. He complained in 1816: 'From 40 years' experience of the wretched guess-work of the newspapers of what is done in the open daylight, and of their falsehood even as to that, I rarely think them worth reading and almost never worth notice.' Media practitioners apparently have to redouble their efforts to put forward a more compelling case against external attempts to meddle with the press freedom they treasure. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/292289\/press-must-do-better"}

Wearing yellow T-shirts, the campaigners asked people to cast their ballots in the Legislative Council by-elections on May 16. They also called on the government to abolish the Legco functional constituencies. The rally was organised by the League of Social Democrats and the Civic Party. Five legislators from the two parties resigned in January to trigger the by-elections, which they say would be a 'de facto' referendum on universal suffrage. If the candidates win back their seats, it will indicate public desire for quicker democratic reform, the two parties say. One marcher said he hoped Hong Kong would implement direct elections for the chief executive and legislators soon. 'The public can't choose their leader or half of the legislature. This is not fair,' Chan Ho-kei said. Organisers said about 3,000 people took part, while police put the number at close to 1,000. The functional constituencies make up half of the 60 seats in Legco. They are reserved for leaders from trades such as finance and tourism, and other professionals.

{"url":"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/702358\/uygurs-decry-reconstruction-project-set-change-face-old-town-kashgar","text":"Uygurs decry 'reconstruction project' set to change the face of old town in Kashgar PUBLISHED : Wednesday, 30 December, 2009, 12:00am At the entrance to the Gaotai neighbourhood in the heart of Kashgar stands a ticket office which still charges 30 yuan (HK$34) per visit to this once popular attraction. 'Ancient residence - a slice of the real Kashgar', a big billboard next to it says. Gaotai (or Koziqiyarbixi, in Uygur, meaning clay highland) has existed for 1,000 years since local people discovered the clay was good for building houses - as well as pottery. The pottery makers working in age-old kilns, the maze-like meandering alleyways, and the second-floor extensions that bridge houses or sometimes simply hang in the air - all these have captured the imagination of visitors to Kashgar, the Silk Road's trading hub in Xinjiang. In today's tourist maps, however, Gaotai can no longer be found. This is because, along with other neighbourhoods, it has been earmarked for demolition under the 'Old Town Reconstruction' project. Once it is completed, parts of the ancient city will be wiped off the map forever. The deadly July 5 ethnic clash between Uygurs and Han in Urumqi did not slow the demolition, neither did warnings from Unesco, the United Nations organisation for heritage protection. By last month nearly 10,000 houses had been torn down since 2001, and the latest deadline for moving out is March. 'Most who already moved away are those with small houses, since the government compensation flats are a standard 50 square metres,' said 47-year-old Kuerbanjiang, whose extended family of 25 shares a 200 square metre courtyard built by his parents. 'If we move away, we will all have to split.' The compensation flats are eight kilometres from the town centre, and are worth about one-tenth the price of property in the old town, the heart of Kashgar. 'If our mud-straw houses are dangerous, perhaps the government could help us refit them with bricks?' suggested the worried head of the family, a social welfare recipient who was struggling to put together university school fees for his daughter. 'Otherwise, at least give us a fair compensation so we can purchase a rural property that is big enough to keep us all together.' The Uygur residents of Kashgar are not alone in facing the relentless bulldozers of development and modernity on the mainland. However, rarely does a reconstruction project affect so much of the population, or stir so much political controversy as the one in Kashgar, which is 90 per cent Uygur and nestles close to the border with Pakistan and Afghanistan. The government has carried out intermittent demolition of old Kashgar since 2001 - 5,000 families had already been resettled since that time from the central Id Kah mosque area. However, the real thrust came in May last year when the Sichuan earthquake provided the basis for the immediate demolition of hundred-year-old dwellings in a city much frequented by earthquakes. This month, the Xinjiang government announced a seven-billion-yuan reconstruction and resettlement project that would affect all 8.36 square kilometres of Kashgar's old town, and a total of 65,000 households - that is 221,000 residents, half of the population. The adobe houses are too old and fragile, the alleys are too narrow for public service access, the irrigation system is poor, and tunnels dug during the Cultural Revolution make the whole area even more earthquake-prone, the government said, emphasising in official media that 'reconstruction' was for the safety of the people and would strengthen ethnic unity. Even a survey of 20,000 residents in February showed overwhelming support for the plan, it said. From mainland media reports the definition of reconstruction seems to include everything from reinforcement carried out by the residents themselves, reconstruction loyal to the traditional form carried out by the government, and resettlement to apartment blocks sponsored by the government. The plan is to reconstruct 50,000 houses by 2015 - 4,678 by November - and thousands of transitional houses will be provided in the meantime. However, the exact number of families that could return to the old town is not known. Questions continue to surround the project. Is it another insensitive - or intentional - step to dilute Uygur culture? Or is it a disproportionate display of a fear that the Kashgar alleyways provide the perfect breeding ground for terrorism? A deadly attack on 17 armed police just before the Olympics last year only reinforced the official line that Kashgar is China's most urgent anti-terrorism battlefront. A leaked memo from a Kashgar government meeting in late February reflected the government's determination to implement the reconstruction. 'Those who think that the Old City represents Uygurs' unique culture, and that this is where Kashgar's beauty, history and culture lie, this is incorrect thinking that ignores the dangers and disasters, and is extremely irresponsible,' the harshly-worded memo read. The reconstruction was a 'serious political issue' and all unco-operative cadres would be dealt with by administrative measures and even the law. 'No cadres are allowed to act out of their own interest, to gossip, disrupt or incite relatives or the public to ask for exorbitant prices from the party and government, to entrap the nation, or to obstruct the transformation of the Old City,' it decreed. The latest controversy comes with the erection of a giant billboard entitled 'Unesco applauds the Old Town Reconstruction Project as a true reflection of the people's interests', which describes how experts recommended the 'precious experience be extended to the outside world'. Beijing-based Unesco cultural officer Beatrice Kaldun told the South China Morning Post that 'the billboard does not reflect the opinion of Unesco' and was taken out of context. 'Overall Unesco is pleased with the efforts of the local authorities with regard to earthquake prevention and improvement of living conditions for the population in the historic Old Town of Kashgar,' Kaldun said. 'But we are concerned about the demolition of sections of its historic fabric and the plans for reconstruction with building materials and techniques that would permanently affect both its buildings and living traditions, as one of the main settlements and trading towns along the Silk Road.' Near 7,000 people have signed an online petition to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pleading the award of a world heritage site status to Kashgar to prevent its demolition. China does not seem to recognise the heritage importance of Kashgar as the world does - the city has been left out in the country's present application of more than two dozens sites along the Silk Road for Unesco recognition. The reconstruction project, approved by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, has had little involvement from heritage experts throughout. A letter available on the website of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage suggests further fissures within the government over the project. Citing a protest by the International Council on Monuments and Sites, the June 16 letter urged Xinjiang authorities to resend experts to Kashgar to evaluate the project in light of its damage to cultural heritage, and report back to the administration by the end of June. There are no public records of correspondence since then. Meanwhile, demolition of Kashgar's oldest Ordaishki mosque - built 400 years earlier than the officially hailed Id Kah mosque of 1442 - and the Royal Scriptures Institute next door had quietly continued, Uygur intellectuals and witnesses said. Kashgar was once the capital of the powerful Turkic Kara-Khanid Khanate in the 10th century, and today only two crooked plaques lying sadly at the site confirmed their past glories as provincial-level heritage. For residents, the fight for their homes goes on. 'Even if I am given a newer home, I don't want to move there,' said 48-year-old Ruxianguli, whose husband makes ornate copper jugs by hand and used to sell them at 100 yuan each to tourists who curiously peeked into their little courtyard in the Qiasa Old Town. It takes him three days to make one, and he used to be able to sell four or five a week - the sole income of the family.

Sun Wenguang, a 77-year-old retired professor formerly with Shandong University, said about 20 rights activists gathered in the capital Jinan on May 6 to commemorate the students and residents who died in the square 23 years ago. Several in the Jinan gathering had been jailed for either taking direct part in the pro-democracy movement or demonstrating against the crackdown later on. 'We are a group of like-minded friends who have met for the fifth time since 2008 to commemorate those killed in Tiananmen Square,' Sun said. The Jinan meeting was followed by a public memorial organised by a group of rights activists, largely in their 60s or 70s, in the heart of Guiyang , the capital of Guizhou province, on Sunday and Monday. To the surprise of some domestic and foreign observers, police did not immediately interfere with the protesters, allowing them to chant slogans and hang banners calling for a reversal of the government's stance on the crackdown. On Wednesday, more than a dozen activists marched to Yanping district court in Nanping , Fujian and unfurled banners calling for a reassessment of the June 4 verdict. 'We went there to vent our anger against the autocratic regime,' said Fan Yanqiong , a 52-year-old woman. 'But we also staunchly support the democratic reforms proposed by Premier Wen Jiabao.' Fan said the protest lasted for about two hours and they disbanded after reading out a petition calling for support for Wen's position. 'I'm neither a relative of those killed, nor do I have any direct connection with the June 4 crackdown,' Fan said. 'But I simply can't help bursting into tears whenever I see pictures or read articles about the suppression of the movement over the years. Only when the leadership reassesses this part of history squarely can the country possibly have a bright future.' Fan said the organisers in Fujian were not connected with those in Guiyang. 'I had not even heard of the protest in Guiyang, let alone had any communication with them before our march.' She said about 100 police officers had monitored them closely, interfering occasionally in their activities. Sun, the retired professor, voiced optimism that the government would reverse its position on the movement. 'We may not be far away from the day when the students are vindicated. Many middle-aged fellow countrymen in their 40s or 50s are well aware of the massacre and the effect it has had on the nation. 'At the top of the party leadership, those like Premier Wen Jiabao have recently been said to favour a reassessment of the incident.' Beijing has so far been reluctant to reassess the position Deng Xiaoping and other party elders took on May 18, 1989, when they defined the incident as a counter-revolutionary riot. Two days later, the government declared martial law and the People's Liberation Army was deployed to clear the streets. Despite the protests in Guizhou, Fujian and Shandong, Hong Kong-based veteran China-watcher Johnny Lau Yui-siu doubted any vindication would occur soon. 'As far as I know, Wen's remarks about the so-called political reforms are nothing but empty talk aimed at comforting those who are desperately eager to see progress towards democracy.' Lau said the Guiyang police appeared to be restrained merely because they did not want to trigger additional protests. Three days after the demonstration in Guiyang, Mei Chongpiao, 73, one of the protest leaders, was taken away after local police had searched his residence, according to his son Mei Zuheng. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/1002744\/june-4-protests-three-provinces"}

'Our policies toward ethnic minorities as a whole won't change,' Tondrub Wangbum, a Tibetan vice-chairman of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, said yesterday in Beijing. Anger about the policy among Han Chinese, by far the largest group among China's 56 ethnic communities, has been exacerbated by the deaths of 192 people, mostly Han, in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi , last week, and the injuries suffered by 1,680 people during clashes between the province's Uygur Muslim minority and Han Chinese. There are nine million Uygurs among Xinjiang's 20 million people, and they are the main targets of blame for the unrest. Critics complain that Beijing's decades-old policies towards ethnic minorities have long been slanted in their favour. The privileges offered to minorities, they say, have backfired, because they have been taken for granted. Compared with one or two children allowed to Han ethnic couples, ethnic minority families are permitted to have three or more as long as they can feed them. The children are also given extra marks to advance them in middle school and college entrance exams as compensation for unequal educational opportunities. Since the mid- 1980s, Beijing has called for 'fewer arrests, fewer death penalties and generally lighter punishments' for criminals from minority groups. 'It's now time for the government to rethink its ethnic minority policies,' a posting on xmhouse.com said. 'These special policies have bred crime by ethnic minorities to an intolerable extent.' However, the argument for maintaining Beijing's policies is aimed at preventing an extreme rift between the Han and the 55 minorities. That is the status quo that the government seems to prefer. 'A united struggle of all ethnic groups for a common prosperity is the keynote of our ethnic policy that will never change,' Mr Wangbum said. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/686951\/beijing-backs-policy-minorities"}

More than 10 people from the Rights Association of Hongkong Post Contract Staff protested outside the General Post Office in Central on Friday, demanding an explanation for what happened to Lo Sek-ho and Kung Sai-kit. “The supervisor has called me rubbish. Every colleague was there during that briefing,” said Lo. Lo, 32, said that due to a traffic accident five years ago he has been having problems feeling and moving his right arm. One big happy family: hotel gives mentally disabled staff a chance to flourish He joined the Tuen Mun office two years ago and had been doing data input instead of other physically-demanding work because of his injury. But when he was given a new supervisor last year, he was instructed to take on new tasks moving heavy packages around the office, he claimed. In January, Lo hurt his left shoulder and neck when a pile of packages about two metres higher fell on him. His injury further affected his performance at work. Since then, he said his supervisor has been insulting and humiliating him in public. He said he has to take painkillers every day and doctors found that he has symptoms of depression. “I have been called rubbish and a disabled person. He called me that in front of every colleague,” Lo said. His supervisor also accused him of “faking injuries”, he said. Under his previous supervisor, Lo was employed on a contract that was renewed on a yearly basis. His new supervisor decided he had to renew his contract every three months soon after he was appointed to the position. Lo’s colleague Kung, 32, who stood up for him, said he received a letter from the supervisor earlier this year saying that management was considering firing Lo. The letter also said that Kung had performance issues, an accusation Kung said was untrue. According to the union’s chairman Danny Tse Tin-wing, the Disability Discrimination Ordinance protects people with disabilities and the associates of those people. Under the ordinance, a disability means total or partial loss of a person’s bodily or mental functions. Protesters bumped into Deputy Postmaster General Ngai Wing-chit, who was on his way back to the office. Ngai immediately invited Lo and Kung to a meeting. But after the 30-minute meeting, the duo said that nothing had been solved. Ngai asked the pair to give him seven days to look into the matter. “I am very angry. The management is using delaying tactics,” Kung said. The duo is considering making a complaint to the Equal Opportunities Commission.

The protests took place despite tight security in Tibetan-populated areas ahead of the March 14 anniversary. At least 20 slogan-chanting students from Machu county's Machu Tibetan Secondary School marched to the county government headquarters on Sunday, a witness said yesterday. He said the students waved snow lion flags as they protested. The flag is used by the Tibetan government in exile in India but is outlawed by mainland authorities. 'They chanted slogans in Tibetan that I don't understand and two of them also waved a banner with Tibetan characters,' he said. He said the student protest, which started out from the school at about 1pm, drew the attention of crowds on the streets and left many non-Tibetan vendors and businessmen scrambling to close their shops. 'The students were tailed by police cars. But the police just followed, they didn't do anything,' he said. 'Many shops are still closed today as some people are still worried by the protests.' Radio Free Asia quoted Machu residents as saying the student shouted slogans decrying the lack of freedom and calling for Tibetan independence. It said the protest was joined by 500 to 600 other Tibetans. The report said at least 40 people were detained by police on Sunday, prompting a fresh round of protest as hundreds of Tibetans demanded the release of the detainees. The man who witnessed the protest said security had tightened up since, with almost all the county's police officers patrolling the streets. 'I heard that officials have been sent to rural areas and schools to talk to the people as a preventive measure,' he said. The Machu police and secondary school refused to comment yesterday on the protest. A similar protest led by teenagers broke out in nearby Hezuo on Sunday, Reuters reported yesterday. The report quoted a hotel employee as saying that at least 20 teenagers were taken in custody by police on Wednesday. March has become a sensitive period for the central government after the pro-independence unrest in 2008 claimed hundreds of lives and prompted international criticism of China's Tibet policies that later turned into calls for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics. The unrest began in Lhasa , capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region , and later spread to other Tibetan areas including Machu. The unrest was sparked by a protest on March 10 that year to mark the anniversary of the failed uprising in 1959 that resulted in the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and his administration fleeing to India. A Tibetan tour guide in Lhasa said yesterday that foreign tourists had been barred from entering Tibet this month and security in the city had been boosted for the anniversary. Beijing has adopted a pump-priming approach in the Himalayan region in an attempt to stifle criticism of a lack of religious freedom and freedom of speech and other human rights violations. But critics say the unrest in 2008 showed that central government policies had failed to address Tibetans' concerns and needs. At a high-level meeting this year to discuss Beijing's development plan for Tibet in the next decade, the central government renewed its pledge of more investment in the autonomous region and other Tibetan-populated areas. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/709016\/tibetans-take-streets-mark-uprising"}

The school is one of two government-subsidised primary schools in Stanley. The other, Cheng's Clansmen General Association Cheng Jack Yiu School, has been forbidden to open Primary One classes since 2005, due to underenrolment. The Education Bureau recently ordered St Teresa's School not to open Primary One classes in the coming school year, since it had failed to enrol the minimum number of students. From the 2008-09 school year, primary schools need at least 21 Primary One pupils to open a class, down from the current minimum of 23. The protesters yesterday marched from the school to Stanley Plaza, chanting slogans including: 'Don't scrap our school', 'Give St Teresa back to me' and 'Stanley must have subsidised primary schools'. They later travelled to the Central Government Offices and handed in a petition to a government representative. Lam Han-yee, the school's parent-teacher association's chairwoman, said: 'Not all parents here can afford the travel expenses to send their children to schools elsewhere, and many of them don't want their kids to commute so far. It will be so tiring.' She said schoolchildren had to go to subsidised schools in Aberdeen - or to the private, primary St Stephen's College Preparatory School in Stanley - if the 63-year-old St Teresa's no longer offered Primary One classes. Ms Lam said the school bus fee to commute between Stanley and Aberdeen - the location of the nearest subsidised school - was about HK$700 a month per student, and pupils who stayed late at school for extracurricular activities would be charged HK$200 more. 'The government is shameful. It did not do any consultation before making the decision,' she said. A Mrs Choi, whose daughter is in Primary Two at the school, said: 'This situation is impossible. In my mainland hometown, there are two primary schools in a small village. Why will there be no subsidised primary schools in a community much larger than a village?' url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/636422\/hundreds-demonstrate-over-schools-primary-one-plight"}
{"url":"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/article\/1492047\/pan-democrats-losing-side-shanghai-fixture","text":"Pan-democrats on the losing side in Shanghai fixture PUBLISHED : Monday, 21 April, 2014, 4:10am After her Shenzhen trip, will Angela Merkel stop in Hong Kong next time? 27 May 2018 We all know that in a soccer match, every player must understand and perform his role if the team is to win the game. By contrast, the public was left perplexed by the actions of another team: the pan-democratic lawmakers who joined last weekend's trip to Shanghai. The key question was: what did they want to achieve? To have a debate with Beijing about arrangements for universal suffrage at the 2017 chief executive election? Or to protest? Or both, if that could be possible? It seems some failed to give sufficient thought to this question before boarding the Shanghai-bound flight. The first challenge, ironically, was not how to deal with Beijing officials but how to react to the activities of one of their own: radical \"Long Hair\" Leung Kwok-hung, who headed home after being told he could not cross the border with slogans and T-shirts with messages seeking the vindication of the 1989 democracy protests. In politics, a lack of unity reduces a group's bargaining power. It's as simple as that Yet Leung had been one of the first to accept the invitation to join the trip. While most pan-democrats questioned whether they were being lured into some kind of \"trap\" by Beijing, Leung made it crystal clear from the outset he intended to protest to Beijing officials over the crackdown on student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Some jokingly suggested that Leung's actions would help enable a smoother discussion with a focus on political reform, rather than a repeat of a 2005 visit by lawmakers, when Leung ended up debating June 4 with Zhang Dejiang , now Beijing's top man on Hong Kong affairs and chairman of the Nation People's Congress, then Guangdong party secretary. For Leung, it was mission accomplished. Whether he managed to get into Shanghai or not, his confrontation with customs officials and high-profile protest were seen by all. Those pan-democrats who did go spared no effort in changing what Beijing had called a \"study and exchange tour\" to allow local lawmakers to observe Shanghai's development into \"political talks\", which they set as a precondition for their participation. They demanded a separate meeting with Beijing officials, and skipped most other events on the itinerary, dismissing them as mere \"sightseeing\". This may help explain why a split emerged in how pan-democrats reacted to the airport affair, rather than a united front to support Leung. Some decided to stay on in Shanghai and discuss 2017 come what may; some decided to leave to protest; finally Civic Party leader Alan Leong Kah-kit cancelled his flight and called off his plan to join the trip later. The divide shows a lack of co-ordination on tactics for negotiation, if not a lack of consensus on their stance towards Beijing. Equally, the \"Long Hair\" episode illustrated Beijing's unwillingness to compromise on matters pertaining to its principles. June 4 and the vindication of the protests remains the biggest taboo on the mainland today. It was no surprise to see Leung, whose intention was to protest about June 4, made unwelcome. In politics, a lack of unity reduces a group's bargaining power. It's as simple as that. This fact was also well illustrated by how Beijing handled arrangements for the trip. When pan-democrats requested a separate meeting, Beijing never said yes. But the tricky thing was that it never said no, either. Eventually, the \"separate meeting\" was facilitated when Beijing-loyalist lawmakers left the venue. It is well known that Beijing does not want to recognise the pan-democratic camp's \"equal status\" in political talks. But Beijing also knows well that the camp is split, and that those who joined the talks could not claim to represent the whole bloc. \"Long Hair\", the icon of radical politics in Hong Kong, played his role as a professional protester well enough this time. But for those who met Beijing officials in Shanghai, and others who claim to be less radical and willing to talk to Beijing for the sake of Hong Kong's democracy, defining a clearer role for themselves is a pressing matter they must devote some serious thought to.

More than 20 associate degree students marched to the Legislative Council on Tuesday to protest at what they see as favouritism towards university students. Li Yiu-kee, secretary general of Hong Kong Federation of Students, said the government should set aside resources to ease pressure on associate degree graduates seeking jobs. 'There are 30,000 associate degree graduates each year in comparison with 14,500 university graduates. Instead of just providing support to degree holders, the government should involve associate degree students in the internship scheme.' In response to queries on insufficient support for associate degree graduates, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Matthew Cheung Kin-chung had earlier recommended that graduates could join the Youth Work Experience and Training Scheme. Fung Wai-wah, convener of the Alliance in Concern of Sub-degree Education, said associate degree graduates were overqualified for the training scheme. 'Associate degree students have invested much time and money in their studies. Asking them to join a scheme aimed at secondary graduates is tantamount to a denial of their efforts. The government should not equate their qualifications with those of secondary school leavers.' Mr Fung said the government should widen the pathways for associate degree graduates to continue their studies. 'Only around 2,000 associate degree graduates get the chance to proceed to subsidised Year Two degree studies in publicly-funded universities every year. 'As the government has increased the number of research places for university graduates, they should also increase the number of subsidised degree places for associate graduates.' Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah earmarked HK$140 million for the internship programme for 4,000 university graduates in the budget in a bid to cut unemployment among graduates amid the sluggish economy. Successful applicants can work as interns in local or mainland enterprises for up to a year. A spokeswoman for the Labour and Welfare Bureau said the Youth Work Experience and Training Scheme would be made more flexible and responsive in meeting the training and employment needs of associate degree students. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/672447\/associate-degree-graduates-say-budget-ignored-jobs-concerns"}

Around 40 residents set out to guard village entrances at 6am on Friday morning after being notified that authorities would enter the village to give formal notice on the project’s infrastructure works. In 2014, the District Council passed a plan to build 4,000 public flats on a heavily vegetated green belt site, which also involved displacing 180 households in three villages - Wing Ning Tsuen, Fung Chi Tsuen and Yeung Uk San Tsuen. Villagers had hoped to confront authorities about their decision and ask for clarification on the project’s timeline, construction details and resettlement options. However, many were angered to find that the government had posted official notices already at the village entrance overnight. “They knew we were going to guard the entrances this morning, so [the government] chose to do it overnight in a cowardly manner,” Ray Lam, a resident from Fung Chi Tsuen, said. “We’ve not been consulted, we’ve been given zero information [on the project]. I took a day off work for this, but they’re not even brave enough to explain all of this to us directly face to face,” Lam said. Government departments are required to gazette their decision online and at the locations involved. In response to inquiries by the Post, a spokesman for the Civil Engineering and Development Department said they posted two notices at the site at around 7.30am on Friday, contradicting the villagers’ accounts of the time they were posted. The two notices authorised road and sewerage works for the Wang Chau project, which would begin in June 2018, the spokesman added. Land resumption is required for the road works, but he did not mention whether the process had begun. Many fear that they would be forced to clear out after construction begins. “The government is building public housing for people to live in, but we’re going to end up on the street. How does that make sense?” 74-year-old resident Lam Yiu-ting said. “I’m not going to get in the way of them trying to build public housing, but they should at least resettle us first,” Lam said. According to current policies, residents affected by a government clear-out can move into public housing if they are qualified or accept compensation, a Lands Department spokesman said.

{"url":"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/comment\/letters\/article\/1616534\/letters-editor-october-15-2014","text":"Letters to the Editor, October 15, 2014 PUBLISHED : Wednesday, 15 October, 2014, 6:26am Government cannot give in to threats There are clearly many serious issues regarding the government, management and long-term future of Hong Kong that need to be addressed urgently. The current government is obviously aware of this. However, the various, and seemingly split, Occupy factions cannot seriously expect any immediate decisions or policy changes, particularly when the existing system to process such matters is completely gridlocked by the oppose-at-all-costs attitudes of the so-called democratic representatives. The intractable and childish attitude of the students to discussions with the government indicates that their teachers are as poor at teaching negotiating skills as they are at teaching history and law. No government is going to bend to \"or else\" threats, especially when such threats are made by an unappointed and unrepresentative minority. The situation is escalating to an inevitably violent conclusion, which is clearly what some of the Occupy leadership would like. They can then play the international sympathy card to capitalise on the well-crafted media myth that this is a \"peaceful\" and fully supported uprising. Kitting yourself out in gas masks and crash helmets does not indicate peaceful intentions. Neither does the barricading of major transport arteries. The self-righteous attitude of the protesters has more similarities with the Red Guards than Woodstock. The right to protest is an essential criteria of any civilised society. This does not, however, extend to a right to disrupt people's lives and livelihoods indefinitely. The government needs to give some ultimatums of its own. The ending to this particular chapter of the story will not be at all pleasant. Mike Tinworth, Lantau Unlawful to obstruct public highways No one doubts that the protesters' right of freedom of assembly and demonstration are guaranteed by Article 27 of the Basic Law. Equally, however, it is unlawful to obstruct public highways which is a criminal offence under the Summary Offences Ordinance. Our Court of Final Appeal has previously ruled on how these conflicting provisions should be reconciled. Mr Justice Kemal Bokhary stated, \"The mere fact that an assembly, a procession or a demonstration causes some interference with free passage along a highway does not take away its protection under art. 27 of the Basic Law. In my view it would not lose such protection unless the interference caused is unreasonable in the sense of exceeding what the public can reasonably be expected to tolerate… the most obviously relevant considerations are, I think, how substantial the interference is and how long it lasts…What the public can reasonably be expected to tolerate is a question of fact and degree.\" The blocking of certain main road arteries in Hong Kong has caused severe inconvenience to large sections of the public and serious economic loss to shopkeepers, taxi drivers and others. The law permits affected groups to apply to court seeking an injunction to prevent unreasonable interference with those rights and to rule on what is reasonable and what is not. The general mood of Hong Kong seems to me to be that the protesters should be allowed to continue their demonstration in suitable areas, but not by blocking our main roads which is not, in my view, a proper, lawful or reasonable way to pressure the government to cave in to their demands. Since there is no end in sight to this Occupy movement, I would therefore urge affected groups and parties to apply to the High Court to rule on the legality of the blockade and to seek an injunction to prevent it continuing. In urgent cases, an interim court ruling can be obtained within a few days and a final hearing can be expedited, especially where there is such an obvious public interest in resolving the point quickly. Simon Westbrook, senior counsel, Central Good political lesson for mainlanders Around Queensway and Harcourt Road, during the Occupy Central protests, there has been a riot of colour with all the umbrellas. They have been a symbol of the protest movement, representing the peaceful intentions of the demonstrators and their desire to have the full implementation of universal suffrage in Hong Kong. What has happened here has attracted attention around the world. While many of these young people boycotted their college classes, they did not forget their civic duties. They were meticulous in their efforts to keep the area clean, picking up litter from the street and recycling material like plastic bottles. I also appreciate the fact that the students continued to do their homework while at the protest site, sometimes having do so in the dark using the torch from their cell phones. It has been dubbed the \"umbrella revolution\" and I see it as a great opportunity for visitors from the mainland (not just students but all tourists) to learn more about democracy. The central government has always cracked down on citizens who speak out about sensitive issues, especially politics. However, under \"one country, two systems\" in Hong Kong, we are allowed to have freedom of speech. Mainland visitors are free to take part in activities here and this can make them more aware of democracy. There are opposing sides, with groups who strongly object to Occupy Central. I urge them to try and stay calm and rational. The government should also set up a platform to accommodate differing opinions and try and reach a consensus. However, a consensus can only be reached if citizens show tolerance for the different views being expressed. Kate Tsang, Tiu Keng Leng Protesters should change their strategy I think the Occupy Central protests have gone too far and if they continue the consequences could be devastating. Public and private transport has paralysed in parts of the city, but that is not the worst aspect. I am concerned about the splits in our society with groups objecting to Occupy Central and some clashes becoming violent. I am not saying the protesters should give up what they are fighting for, but wouldn't it be better if they changed their location, gathering instead in front of the central government liaison office? I think this would cause less disruption to the lives of Hong Kong citizens and would still put pressure on the government. Of course, the best solution is for the government and Occupy Central activists to sit down and talk, however, I do not see that happening in the near future. Therefore in the interests of society, it is time for the protesters to take a step back. Chan Yan-lam, Yau Yat Chuen Concerns over spread of Ebola virus Most citizens in Hong Kong are focused on the Occupy Central movement, but we should not forget what is happening in the rest of the world and the risk we could face from the spread of the Ebola virus. The outbreak in West Africa is spreading and Hong Kong could be affected at some point. I wonder if checks at all entry points are tight enough to ensure that anyone coming into Hong Kong who may display symptoms which could be Ebola is isolated immediately and tested for the disease. We must ensure that all the necessary precautions are being taken to prevent someone who is infected being able to mingle with the population. The government should clarify what kind of precautions are being taken and assure us that they are effective.

Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun's warning came as the democratic camp began drawing up a strategy to mobilise public support for democratisation during the summer, following the imminent release of a green paper on political reform. Speaking three days after he made his first appearance at the July 1 pro-democracy march, the cardinal said he wanted to see the green paper provide a clear indication of how the city should progress towards universal suffrage. 'Donald Tsang has promised he would resolve the question of universal suffrage. If the green paper does not achieve that, if it does not bring us clearly towards that goal but takes us on a walk in the park, then I will definitely 'make it big' this time,' he said. Cardinal Zen would not elaborate on this but added he might write articles about how democracy would be beneficial to the people, as the city was already late in planning for a democratic future. 'My joining of the July 1 march was just a warming-up exercise,' he said. Tens of thousands marched on Sunday calling for more democracy and improved livelihoods. Cardinal Zen's comments come two days after Liu Bainian , a deputy chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, hit out at his participation in the democracy rally, saying it would not help Sino-Vatican relations. During the height of the controversy over Hong Kong's political future in 2005 when the government's constitutional reform proposal was criticised as not going far enough and was rejected by the legislature, the leader of the city's Catholic diocese backed the democrats. His call for speedy action towards full democracy follows a pledge by Mr Tsang to 'go all out' in finding a consensus on the way forward. The democratic camp met last night to discuss how to mobilise public support in the fight for introducing universal suffrage ahead of the green paper's release. Democrat Lee Wing-tat said since it was expected that the document would not contain any concrete reform proposals but would consult the public over different elements related to universal suffrage, the public might find it difficult to understand and lose interest. 'Our task over the summer is to maximise public awareness by simplifying the proposal so that people's power can be mobilised. To tell the truth, I still have some faith in Donald [Tsang] to come up with something acceptable, since he has made a promise,' Mr Lee said. Ronny Tong Ka-wah, of the Civic Party, said his party would not accept the green paper if it did not contain a clear timetable stating how and when Hong Kong could introduce universal suffrage. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/599389\/act-reform-or-stakes-rise-zen-tells-tsang"}

Party chairman Lee Wing-tat said the recent responses of the chief executive and other politicians had reinforced the impression that the subject of June 4 was taboo. He said their attitude raised concerns whether freedom of expression remained a core value in Hong Kong. 'Whether the chief executive attended the 1989 concert is, in fact, not important,' Mr Lee said in RTHK Radio 3's Letter to Hong Kong programme yesterday. 'What's important is that by hastily rejecting the claim that he took part and by distancing himself from the alliance, the chief executive has helped reinforce the impression that June 4 has become a taboo subject in the city,' he said. Szeto Wah, the chairman of the Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, has claimed that Mr Tsang joined the Concert for Democracy in China, which was held at the Happy Valley racecourse days before the crackdown in Beijing. Mr Tsang has vehemently denied that he attended the concert, but admitted he had bumped into Mr Szeto after dinner with his son. Mr Tsang also said the public could judge June 4 objectively when taking into account the economic development in the mainland over the past years. Mr Lee said the public participation in the annual June 4 candlelight vigil at the Victoria Park showed Hong Kong still embraced freedom of expression as one of its core values. But Mr Tsang and other officials seemingly had difficulties coming to terms with their past actions, Mr Lee said. '[They] attempt to avoid getting embroiled in the discussion of the sensitive issue, either by simply remaining silent or taking a fairly vague stance that China had undergone substantial development over the years,' he said. The Democrat said it was disturbing that the chief executive and others dared not speak their minds regarding June 4. 'It is perhaps true that we should not let the incident of 17 years ago shape our views of the mainland,' he said. 'But it is equally true that neither will turning the issue into a taboo and refusing to give a moral judgment help alleviate the pain.' url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/552465\/tsang-criticised-over-attitude-june-4"}

Justice V. Jagannathan rejected the bail petition, saying that granting bail to Maudany “would put the security of the nation in jeopardy.” He said the prosecution had placed materials before the court showing that Maudany was in touch with some of the accused before and after the blasts. The State, he said, had also provided material to the court about the shelter given by Maudany at his home in Kerala to some of those who were involved in the blasts. The court upheld the contention of the Advocate-General Ashok Haranahalli, who appeared for the State, that releasing Maudany would pose a security threat. Senior counsel B.V. Acharya, appearing for Maudany, said there was no direct evidence to link his client with the blasts. He said that Maudany did not initially figure in the FIR. His name was only added subsequently. The court, however, observed that, “there is seldom direct evidence in such cases.” It said, conspiracy is generally hatched in complete secrecy as otherwise the whole purpose will be frustrated.” It said inference could be drawn from whatever evidence had been placed and collected and it was “sufficient to point out the conspiracy.” When it was pointed out that Maudany was ailing, the court directed the jail authorities in Bangalore where he is now housed to take steps to ensure that his health condition did not deteriorate and that he be provided all medical help. Earlier, the Advocate-General placed before the court details of Maudany's telephone records. The court took note of these records and said they pointed to a prima facie case against Maudany. It said though personal liberty was very important, the interest of the State also could not be lost sight of. If a case that involved the security of the State and the nation, bail was generally refused. This, it said, was one such case where the “interest of the nation can never be given up.” url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/Maudanys-bail-plea-rejected\/article15380064.ece"}

O.) issued on April 30, 1997, would take effect only from February 23, 2006. The ruling was issued by a full bench comprising Justices M. Jaichandren, S. Nagamuthu and M. Venugopal, constituted to consider whether the service regularisation of the sanitary workers would be in effect from the time of their initial appointment or after completion of three years of service. Originally, a batch of writs were filed before a single judge by the sanitary workers from the Madurai Corporation and Nagercoil Municipality seeking regularisation of their services from the time of completion of three years of service and seeking payment of arrears and other consequential benefits. According to the petitioners, they were appointed as sanitary workers on a consolidated pay based on a G.O. issued on April 30, 1997. As per the G.O., the recruits appointed in 1998 and 1999 would work under a consolidated pay scale for three years and on completion of three years, the government would consider regularising their service and providing them time-scale pay, the petitioners submitted. But, the government did not consider regularising their services after completion of three years and regularised them only from February 23, 2006, they pointed out. In their order, the judges observed: “The government had an option to examine the question of regularisation, which the government did only in 2006 and it is the wisdom of the government to give regularisation from any date. As per the G.O., it is fallacious to contend that on completion of three years from the date of initial appointment, such appointed sanitary workers shall be regularised.” url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-tamilnadu\/hc-ruling-on-service-regularisation\/article5409513.ece"}

Mr. Ahmad in his letter writes that incidents such as this, “in particular, are creating an atmosphere of fear and suspicion among the Muslims across the country and deteriorating the amity among communities that have traditionally lived together in peace and harmony.” “We believe that there is a need for a very strong statement from the highest levels of the government stating that such outlandish behaviour will neither be tolerated nor can it go unpunished and that the secular credentials of India will be protected by the state at all costs,” Mr. Ahmad has stated in his letter. “It is true that law and order is a State subject, but certainly the Central government would be well within its powers to ask the States to handle such situations with a heavy hand and to enforce a sense of security among the minorities in all seriousness,” he said. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/Minorities-panel-voices-concern-over-attack-on-Muslims\/article14993115.ece"}

Rajasekhara Reddy’s visit to the semi-arid Thamballapalle constituency lasted only for an hour, it was full of ‘negative activity’. Journalists who reached the remote village of Kalicherla from Tirupati, Chittoor and Madanapalle were in for a shock when they were denied entry into the public meeting premises. While even mandal leaders were allowed after frisking, the policemen asked the scribes to take a detour, where they had to face a similar unpleasant experience. Ironically, the police failed to consider the ‘entry pass’ signed and issued by none other than the Superintendent of Police and said they were ‘invalid’. Enraged at the humiliation, the two dozen and odd journalists staged a sit-in right at the entrance to the venue for 20 minutes and shouted slogans against the police officials. It was only after the Minister for Medical Education Galla Arunakumari and SP K. Lakshmi Reddy intervened that they were allowed into the premises. Even as Dr. Reddy was addressing the public meeting, a mob of youngsters representing MRPS started waving banners carrying the letters ‘A-B-C-D’ and decrying the ‘injustice’ done to the community by not taking up categorisation of SCs. Startled at the sudden rise of slogans from the crowd, the thoroughly-embarrassed cops took to heels to control the mob, not before they caught the attention of the Chief Minister. Though irked at the sloganeering, Dr. ReddyYSR acknowledged them saying: Did I say No to ABCD? Shankar, a local industrialist and an aspirant for the Thamballapalle ticket left the venue in a huff, when he was reportedly asked to leave the dais. Another local leader from Madanapalle D.Thippa Reddy too was denied entry on to the dais.

All the seven accused, including Mr. Raja were present. The prosecution as well as defence counsel examined Pandi Murugu, daughter of petitioner Subbu Raj.

Curfew continued in the town without any relaxation. The district town of Tonk, which also witnessed communal tension during the Holi celebration on Saturday, was peaceful. The fort town of Chittaurgarh, 322 km from here, was rocked by communal violence when mobs attacked shops, kiosks and cabins near Qazi Shah’s dargarh and set them on fire. According to the police sources, about 30 shops were torched. Eyewitness accounts said the mobs, armed with weapons and inflammable material, selectively targeted the shops of tailors and cloth merchants even as the police remained a “mute spectator” to the violence. The police control room is situated just opposite the dargah. Arson also took place at a number of other places in the city and the majority of the 35 injured persons were those wounded in the police lathicharge and firing of teargas shells. Trouble erupted in the town on Friday during an Id-e-Miladunnabi procession, when two youths clashed over the erection of a temporary wooden gate on the route. Though the tension subsided after the two communities reached a settlement on the issue, violence flared up the next day without any visible provocation. The police have arrested an unspecified number of people from both the sides, while those injured were admitted to the Government hospital.

But the facts of the event belied all wrong notions and negative vibes passed into the oblivion as the sammelan became a success, though adversaries kept on threatening to spoil the show over one or the other pretext. There were many minor lacunae, of course. They pertained to food and its quality, accommodation, difficulty in reaching the venue, the Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa College grounds, choked toilets, and the biting cold in evenings. However, many were of the opinion that ‘everything was good’ since a tiny place such as Madikeri was hosting the show. Lots of dust flying in the air at the venue made many sick. The threat by a committee formed by citizens to oppose the K. Kasturirangan Committee report on western ghats in Kodagu to observe a bandh on January 7 dissipated after Chief Minister Siddaramaiah assured a delegation of the committee to look into the issue. A group of people who wanted the president of the sammelan Na. D’Souza to tender apologies for his remarks on the Kasturirangan committee report had even succeeded in reaching the dais. But, Mr. D’Souza stated he did not issue any statement supporting the implementation of the report in Kodagu. The group opposing previous sammelan president Ko. Chennabasappa’s book glorifying Tipu and the other supporting the book too had threatened to spoil the show. Statements of the Central Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Bangalore, Pundalika Halambi, created a sensation when he accounted for the curtailment of the speech of Mr. D’Souza, but he later apologised. Short-circuit causing fire when a particular session was on created a minor scare after which the fire was doused in time. The small or narrow roads of Madikeri looked as if they were unable to ‘bear the load’ of people who walked from the Maitree Police Hall junction to the venue, while vehicles with official passes scrambled along precariously avoiding the surging crowd. Locals were seen thronging book stalls and participating in the evening cultural programmes. They reaffirmed their faith in dance and music as they would do during the famous Madikeri Dasara festivities. Policemen had a tough job in controlling the crowd, indulging in verbal duels with people. However, not much was done by them when hundreds of government employees, including teachers, played spoilsport close to the dais on all three days of the sammelan, shouting slogans demanding OOD coupons to claim the benefits while they went back to their respective workplaces. A large number of visitors empathised with the organisers. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-karnataka\/kannada-sahitya-sammelan-brings-people-more-closer-than-ever-in-kodagu\/article5572548.ece"}

Mony for his sensational disclosure the other day that the CPI(M) eliminated its enemies during the 1980s according to a list prepared for the purpose. The Idukki district police registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Mr. Mony and a few others under Sections 302 (murder), 109 (abetment) and 118 (concealing design to commit offence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The FIR was registered on the basis of legal advice received by the government and the police on the course of action in the light of Mr. Mony's statement. Mr. Mony had, while addressing a rally at Thodupuzha in the district on Saturday, said that killings were nothing new to the CPI(M) as the party had finished off around 13 Congress workers in the early 1980s. The first was shot, the second beaten to death and a third stabbed. Following these deaths, the remaining Congressmen had fled and later returned only after taking the permission of CPI(M) leaders, he had said. Idukki Superintendent of Police George Varghese told The Hindu on Monday that Thodupuzha DySP Antony Varghese had been directed to register a case on the basis Mr. Mony's statement. The Thodupuzha Circle Inspector of Police would investigate the cases in question. State Police Chief Jacob Punnoose told The Hindu separately that evidence was being collected to reopen the cases mentioned in the reported statement. Soon after reports of Mr. Mony's statement started appearing in the visual media, inferences were made that Mr. Mony was alluding to the killing of Ancheri Baby, Mullanchira Mathai and Muttukad Nanappan, all of them Congress workers, in the early eighties. Senior police officials pointed out that the trial process in these cases was completed and the accused were exonerated for want of evidence. Ancheri Baby was shot dead on November 13, 1982. It is said that the gun produced in court was rejected as unusable by forensic experts, leading to the acquittal of the accused. Mullanchira Mathai was beaten to death on January 16, 1983, but lack of witnesses led to the acquittal of 11 CPI(M) activists arraigned in the case.

They instantly responded by shouting a firm “no”. The TDP president lambasted the government for doing injustice to the farmers of 111 special economic zones in the State.

The economic blockade imposed by the UNC, an umbrella body of Naga groups under the patronage of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah), against the Manipur government’s decision to carve out seven new districts, has continued for over four months now. The UNC sees the move as an attempt to truncate the concept of a greater Nagalim. The Centre has been accused of turning a blind eye to the activities of the UNC, with which the Union government had signed a framework agreement in 2015 to resolve the decades-old Naga issue. “We will soon send a notice for holding talks with UNC and the Manipur government. Let’s see, if they respond to the notice. Last time, on 15th November, 2016, when such meeting was held, no representative of the Manipur government showed up,” said a senior government official. The official added that the meeting has been proposed to be held in Delhi on February 5, 2017. Last week, the Centre pressed into service two C-17 Globemaster cargo aircrafts to airlift six fuel tankers to Imphal. An official said that 96 kilolitres of petrol was airlifted to ease the oil shortage in the State. Ending the deadlock The Union government even sought Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi’s opinion to end the economic blockade. After consultation, it concluded that no law permitted Centre to interfere in the matter, as law and order was a State subject. “We have been sending Central forces and are doing our bit. The State government has not been forthcoming to end the deadlock as the current situation would help them in the upcoming elections,” said the official. Manipur is going to the polls on March 4 and 8 and due to the ongoing economic blockade, it has been kept in the most sensitive category, an official said, adding that elections were being held in two phases for the first time in the State.. Around 17,500 Central forces are deployed in Manipur currently and another 50,000 would reach there in March after elections in the other four States are over. The Centre has even kept choppers and aircraft on standby, in case forces need to be airlifted. Home Minister Rajnath Singh had earlier sent a tough message to Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh that if the State government failed in discharging its constitutional duties, the Centre “may have to explore other measures under the provisions of Constitution of India to ensure that the difficulties of the people of Manipur are alleviated.” Home Ministry’s worry The Home Ministry had earlier written a letter to the Election Commission of India (ECI) regarding the “ongoing tension and grave law and order situation” and requested it to defer the elections in the State in wake of shortage of security forces. The EC overruled Home Ministry’s apprehensions and announced that polls will be held in the State in two phases on March 4 and 8. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/Centre-to-hold-talks-to-end-Manipur-crisis\/article17119433.ece"}

Traders pulled down their shutters to join the statewide agitation to oppose the State Government's move to amend the APMC Act on Friday. Several traders under the banner of Belgaum Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI) staged a demonstration in front of the Deputy Commissioner's office. BCCI president Vikas R. Kalghatagi led the protest. MOU signed According to BCCI, the anxiety of the farming community and foodgrain traders had come true when a Memorandum of Understanding between Bharathi Enterprises of India and Wal-Mart of the USA was signed. The MoU opened entry of Foreign Direct Investment in the retail trade. Unfortunately, the MoU was signed ignoring the fact that entry of Wal-Mart in retail trade in other countries had ruined native traders and the farming community owing to monopolisation of trading activities in the foodgrain sector. Ironically, growing levels of poverty among farmers was one of its contributions. The BCCI said the Government of India had advised the state governments to amend the Act only to suit the requirements of Wal-Mart. The Karnataka Government had already directed officials to issue an ordinance amending the Act soon. Mr. Kalghatagi alleged that the State Government had taken steps to amend the Act without consulting the farming community or the traders' organisations, which would be directly affected by the amendment. He submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister, Minister for Agriculture, Minister for Food & Civil Supplies. While strongly opposing the proposed amendment, he said the BCCI had urged the Government to review its decision to transfer the national market to foreign companies in view of the latter making quick inroads into domestic retail markets. No business Correspondent from Hubli reports Agriculutre Produce Market Committees (APMC) across the districts of Dharwad, Haveri and Gadag didn't do any business on Friday as the merchants and brokers kept their shops closed as part of the APMC bandh.

Even the merchants and brokers operating outside the APMC yards in various towns and cities closed the shutters of their shops in response to the bandh. In Hubli and Dharwad most of the shops of merchants in the busy market areas were closed. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-karnataka\/Traders-against-plan-to-amend-APMC-Act\/article14702487.ece"}

Sources told The Hindu that an identification document, issued by the Election Commission, belonging to Mohammad Ashraf Paddar, a schoolteacher from Jammu and Kashmir, detained on suspicion of having participated in the attack, was found outside a military facility in Bangalore on September 5. Concerned at a possible terrorist strike on their premises, the Army authorities promptly forwarded the card to the Police Commissioner, asking for verification of his antecedents. The Bangalore police officials, however, forwarded this request to the Jammu and Kashmir police, through the Intelligence Bureau, only on December 29. Jammu and Kashmir police officials, contacted by The Hindu , said their Bangalore counterparts' failure to follow the common-sense procedure - of phoning Srinagar for verification of the document - highlighted serious problems in the functioning of the force. \"We get calls several times a week from our colleagues in other States,\" a senior official said, \"and teams often visit us for follow-up investigation. The Bangalore police could have just picked up the phone or put someone on a flight.\" The Jammu and Kashmir police authorities say they are still unsure whether Paddar visited Bangalore in the weeks before the attack or whether the card was used by another individual with or without his consent. Paddar reported the loss of his card, issued just before the 2002 Assembly elections, soon after he obtained it. In 2003, he applied for and received a fresh card from the Election Commission. With no record of his involvement in terrorism, Paddar is an unlikely suspect. The Jammu and Kashmir police say his brother was murdered by terrorists some years ago. Investigators say Paddar has given a number of contradictory statements that have fuelled suspicion of his possible role in the Bangalore attack. For example, Paddar first said he had not travelled outside the State in years but then admitted to visiting Shimla in Himachal Pradesh some months ago. Whether or not Paddar was involved in the attack, sources close to the investigation seem increasingly convinced that the assault rifles and grenades used in the Bangalore strike were transported from Jammu and Kashmir. Local Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives are thought to have made arrangements to transport and harbour an assault unit from Jammu and Kashmir but did not participate in the attack. News that Paddar's card was found outside a military facility means it may also be considered a target. The Lashkar cells have often used similar tactics. Several separate Lashkar units, for example, carried out the recent serial bombings in New Delhi, communicating only through Tariq Ahmad Dar, the organisation's alleged principal organiser in Srinagar. For the 2002 attack on the Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, separate cells were charged with transporting fidayeen to the city, moving their weapons and transporting them to the site of assault. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/warning-wasted-in-bangalore\/article3236979.ece"}

Mallady The listed companies do not turn up for the event `TARGET' 06' MADURAI: A job fair promising recruitment in leading companies, including multinationals, turned out to be a disappointment to hundreds of college students and job seekers as the listed companies did not turn up for the event, `TARGET'06,' here on Saturday. After long hours of anxious wait for the recruitment process to continue, the students began to agitate as there was no sign of any interview. Men and women from various districts and also from Kerala and Andhra Pradesh were wooed by the advertisement of \"free admission\" to the fair in which MNCs were supposed to have participated. However, the organiser, studentsmart.in, put up six counters on the American College premises to collect a registration fee of Rs. 100 for participating in the interview. Besides, it also collected Rs. 300 towards a workshop on career and development. The amount was collected in cash and in the form of demand drafts. After conducting an aptitude test for a section of aspirants, the candidates were asked to wait till 2 p.m. for the interview, which never happened. While a few representatives were in the venue, the Managing Director of the portal went missing. Enquiries by candidates with representatives about the participating companies proved futile. With no proper answers, the candidates grew suspicious. The agitated students, who had gathered outside the college campus, drew the attention of the city police. Even enquiries by the authorities of American College, which had had given the premises to conduct the fair \"free of cost,\" on the money collected and the number of candidates registered did not evoke any proper response. With the students becoming restless, the Principal, T. Chinnaraj Joseph Jaikumar, insisted that the organiser refund the registration fee immediately. \"I gave the venue in the interest of the arts and science students and I am answerable to them. I will not tolerate any damage to the reputation of our institution ... and will sue you if the reputation is spoiled,\" he warned. As the situation was about to go out of control, the organiser began to return the demand drafts\/cash to the candidates in the presence of police and American College staff. However, the candidates who had registered online and paid the amount could not get any reply about their fee. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-tamilnadu\/jobseekers-turn-disappointed\/article3070146.ece"}

February 10, 2009 00:00 IST Mohamed Nazeer LDF government has failed to deliver, says Chandy HOSANGADI (KASARAGOD): The ‘Kerala Raksha March’ (Save Kerala March) led by Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Ramesh Chennithala was flagged off here on Monday. The march got under way with Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy handing over the party flag to Mr. Chennithala at a public function here in the evening. Speeches of Congress leaders who addressed a large gathering of party men made it abundantly clear that all major issues prominent in the political discourse of the State would be highlighted by the march visiting all constituencies in the State. In his inaugural address, Mr. Chandy said the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government had failed to deliver as it was marred by rift in the Cabinet, the leading ruling party and the ruling front. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre had sanctioned various projects and packages for the State totalling Rs.40,000 crore, he said adding the LDF government had miserably failed to implement them. The law and order situation in the State had worsened during the 32 months of the LDF rule, he said recalling the initiative of the previous United Democratic Front government to end violence in Kannur and Nadapuram. Pinarayi’s march Mr. Chandy said the march led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary Pinarayi Vijayan was leaving a trail of clashes and violence, though the march’s motto was ‘prosperous Kerala. ’ He said the latest statement of CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat amounted to an admission that it had abandoned its anti-corruption plank. Lavalin issue Referring to the SNC Lavalin issue, he said the CPI(M) leadership’s reaction to the Central Bureau of Investigation’s report seeking to arraign Mr. Vijayan as one of the accused in the SNC Lavalin case was not befitting a party functioning in the democratic process. Though the CBI probe was ordered during the UDF rule, the CBI had taken over the investigation under the High Court’s instructions, he said dismissing the CPI(M) charge that the case was politically motivated. Alleging that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was involved in divisive politics, Mr. Chandy said only the Congress could ensure protection of minority communities. The Congress alone could offer a secular government, he added. In his address, Mr. Chennithala said no one could subvert the investigation in the SNC Lavalin case. He said the CPI(M) was trying to bring the BJP back to power. Mr. Karat’s announcement that his party would support any secular government formed by a non-Congress-led front amounted to abandoning the idea of a third alternative. KPCC vice-president Ramesh Chennithala presided over the function. Party leaders G. Karthikeyan, M.M. Jacob, K. Sudhakaran, P.C. Chacko, K.C. Venugopal, M.K. Raghavan, Thalekunnil Basheer, M.I.

Students went on strike When the students realised that the ESIC was not making efforts to rectify the deficiencies they went on strike demanding assurance that their colleges would continue to run. In March, Union Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya had said that all the four medical colleges currently operational would be run and the State government also said that the seat matrix from the previous years would be followed. However, last week, the MCI website notified that all the four ESIC medical colleges in the country were not permitted to admit students. Sources in the State Health Department said the college had rectified the deficiencies but the MCI had to abide by a Supreme Court order that no inspection can be done after May 15.

A helicopter would later come to take the bodies away. In the combing operations the next day, four more Maoists were found hiding in the hills. They were killed as well. When this reporter and photographer, along with the Human Rights Forum team reached this village, ten days after the shootings, signs of the bloodbath still lay strewn around in mute witness: cauliflowers, bottle gourds, pointed gourd, cooked rice that was rotting, half burnt caps, tiffin boxes, plates, raincoats, shoes, the smell of it all rising above the flies and the ants. The tree line stood silent 50 metres away. The villagers were reluctant to even point to the site where the shootings occurred, so scared are they. They recalled how on the evening of October 23, the Maoists went calling on the neighbouring villages, seeking about half a dozen able- bodied men, who, armed with bows and arrows would provide logistical support to Maoists. The underlying hope was that the adivasis would later venture to sign up as Maoists as well. Some 15 or 16 men had been taken to the camp. No one had seen the Greyhounds. They had come through the forests, not taking the narrow, beaten path unusable in the rains, reached the hill overlooking the Maoist camp that began where the gradient began, took up positions, and waited for the day to break. From up the hill they had a clear line of fire. They could pick their targets, take them out one by one. Some of the dead must have been brushing their teeth when the bullets started coming. Villagers still missing While the police declared that 30 Maoists were killed, the latter in a letter identified 27 of them. According to local villagers, about 17 locals had been taken away by the Maoists for support. While nine were from Dakapadar village, six were from Bachilipadar and two from Kajuriguda village. Of these, only three from Bachilipadar have returned. One was accounted for as dead. His body was found in a culvert five days after he had died, when Maoists came to the village to do an aftermath assessment. The dead man was identified as being from Bachilipadar. The whereabouts of as many as 13 villagers is not known. Five days after the shooting, on October 30, villagers from all the surrounding villages met but decided not to inform the police. “We are in a state of confusion. We do not know whether they are alive or in police custody or the Maoists have taken them,” said a villager from Beijingi, where the meeting was held. Not surprising, for in these parts where bullets can come from any direction, and sometimes you can’t tell who is doing the shooting. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/On-the-scent-of-Maoists-Greyhounds-leave-Ramgarh-villagers-in-shock\/article16155793.ece"}

Sanjay Dutt should complete his sentence,” said BJP leader Vinod Tawde. “For this government, some people are clearly more equal than others,” alleged Shiv Sena leader Subhash Desai.

The State was yet to send its response to the Union Home Ministry (MHA). Officials said the Centre’s move was merely a matter of procedure. The President had to forward every petition filed on behalf of a convict to the MHA for its recommendation. The MHA then sent it to the State concerned. Once this was received, it made a recommendation to the President to accept or reject the petition. The President took the final decision. The actor had earlier served 18 months in prison, and needed to spend another 42 months behind bars. The families of some of the other 1993 serial blasts convicts had also filed pardon petitions. Among these was the petition filed on behalf of Kersi Adajania who was convicted for helping to melt the AK-56 rifle which Mr. Dutt had stored in his house.

Venkatesan New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to restrain the Gujarat government from circulating, publishing and acting on the Nanavati Commission report on the Godhra train carnage. (The commission, appointed by the State government, said the February 27, 2002 fire aboard coach S-6 of the Sabarmati Express at the Godhra station was a “pre-planned conspiracy by local Muslims.”) A Bench, consisting of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justice P. Sathasivam, however, issued notice to the government on a special leave petition filed by Citizens for Justice and Peace against a Gujarat High Court order refusing to pass an interim order restraining it from placing the report in the Assembly. Senior counsel Rajinder Sachar said there was no provision under law for a commission to submit an interim report particularly when there were several terms of reference. He said the High Court earlier restrained the tabling of the Justice Banerjee Committee report on the same issue in Parliament. (The Banerjee Committee, appointed by Railway Minister Lalu Prasad, said the fire was “purely accidental.”) Mr. Sachar argued that the Nanavati Commission had named the conspirators and if the government arrested them, communal harmony would be distrubed. When Justice Balakrishnan asked counsel whether the commission had given any specific direction to the government or recommendations for implementation of the report, Mr. Sachar said “We have not gone through the report.” Justice Balakrishnan said: “It would not be possible to pass an interim order without hearing the Gujarat government.” The Bench then posted the matter to October 13. The petitioner said tabling one part of the Nanavati report and making it public was detrimental to the public interest. It questioned the commission’s action in withholding the report on the “dubious role” of the State government in supporting the accused involved in the carnage against the minority community, which followed the train fire.

Addressing a meeting of people's representatives, officials, and leaders of the action council for the development of the NH, he said the package would be based on the provisions of the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act under the consideration of the Cabinet. He told the meeting that the compensation would be equivalent to the market value of the land. Mr. Chandy assured the meeting that a committee including elected representatives would be constituted to resolve complaints about the alignment of the four-lane highway. A video copy of the revised alignment would be provided to the people's representatives. The Chief Minister added that the land required for the project would be acquired only after compensating the families that would lose their land or buildings. The meeting decided to take up the development of 10 junctions on the route. Bus bays would be constructed on government land. The road from the Balaramapuram junction to the railway line and Vizhinjam spinning mill would be developed to a width of 30.2 metre. Minister for Public Works V.K.

While the leaders of the major political parties are busy participating in public meetings and road shows, functionaries are engaged in door-to-door canvassing never mind the the scorching sun. That the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) are taking the elections seriously is evident in the fact that stalwarts of these parties are campaigning in earnest for their respective candidates. With only a couple of days left for the curtains to fall on public campaigning, voters still await star campaigners, including ‘Dream girl' Hema Malini. While the Opposition parties targeted the BJP for alleged scams and misadministration, the BJP banked on the development mantra and spoke about the corrupt practices and failures of the rival parties. Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramiah, KPCC president G. Parameshwara and Minister of State for Railways K.H. Muniyappa led the Congress campaign trail in the constituency. The party organised a number of conventions which were addressed by Union Labour Minister M. Mallikarjun Kharge, the former Chief Minister, Dharam Singh, senior leaders D.K. Shivkumar, V.S. Ugrappa, Rehman Khan and C.M. Ibrahim, among others. JD(S) bandwagon It was the former Chief Minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy, who shared the burden of campaigning on behalf of the JD(S) candidate in this segment. Mr. Kumaraswamy took part in road shows and other campaigning activities for three consecutive days. The former Agriculture Minister, K. Srinivasa Gowda, senior leaders C. Narayanaswamy, Bandeppa Kashempur, MLA G.K. Venkatashiva Reddy are among others who joined the JD(S) campaigning. As for the BJP, Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa has been leading from the front. He took up two whirlwind tours in the constituency. Home and Transport Minister R. Ashok and Minister for Power Shobha Karandlaje are the other two other prominent BJP leaders camping in the area to garner support for the voters. CPI (M) campaigning The Communist Party of India (Marxist), though not fielding a candidate here, is supporting the JD(S) and appealing to the voters to defeat the “communal and corrupt” BJP, and the Congress for its “anti-people policies”. It has organised a political convention to mobilise support to secular forces. CPI (M) State secretariat members G.C. Bayya Reddy and G.N. Nagaraj, State committee member Gandhinagar Narayanaswamy, district secretary G. Arjunan are the prominent leaders involved in the campaigning. While actor Hema Malini is to address a public meeting on April 6, the Congress is still hoping to rope in Telugu superstar Chiranjeevi, who has merged his Praja Rajyam Party with Congress for campaigning in the segment where a large number of Telugu-speaking people reside.

But it is increasingly becoming evident that not only was the political victory short-lived, the country is paying a heavy price for the cross-LoC strike on September 29. While the Pakistan Army refused to admit that the surgical strikes ever took place, it has since been retaliating: unstated, surreptitiously and through proxies. Consider this: with Saturday’s attack on an Indian army convoy in Kashmir’s Pampore, the armed forces in Kashmir have lost over 60 men this year alone. Along with this disturbing rise in the attacks on Army camps across Jammu and Kashmir, the LoC and International Boundary (IB) in the State are also alarmingly tense today. Ceasefire violation-related military casualties on the Indian side itself are 12 so far, highest since the ceasefire agreement — which has all but collapsed now — was arrived at in 2003. Strategic implications of the strikes From a military point of view, the cross-LoC operation was limited and carefully calibrated: there was no targeting of Pakistani military installations as the operation was claimed to be against terror camps and not against the Pakistan Army, and the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) telephoned his Pakistani counterpart after the operations ended and conveyed the counter-terrorist intent behind the strike. The DGMO further clarified that the “Indian Army conducted surgical strikes at several of these launch pads ‘along’ Line of Control.” Moreover, the operation was hardly a surprise to Rawalpindi given the high level of political and military signalling from the Indian side between the Uri attack and the surgical strikes. The Pakistan Army is also said to have monitored a great deal of ‘operation-related chatter’ from the Indian side. Indeed, New Delhi’s post-strike triumphalism did have negative reputational impact on the all-powerful General Headquarters in Rawalpindi and for the Nawaz Sharif government in Islamabad. If so, why did the Pakistan Army not resist, or hit back after New Delhi hailed the military action as a blockbuster victory (even though we now know that such operations were conducted in the past as well)? Does this mean that Rawalpindi displayed a certain amount of tolerance for the Indian military action given that it was carried out after 19 Indian soldiers were killed, and national anger was mounting in India? I recently asked a senior (retired) Pakistani General about the ‘level of tolerance’ for potential surgical strike-like action in future by India. I was told rather bluntly that it would depend on the Pakistan Army’s complicity in the attack: the more the complicity, the less the retaliation. Or differently put, no complicity would mean definite retaliation. While this might appear to provide an operational window for future Indian military action across the LoC below the Pakistani redline, a proactive military strategy based on the assumption of Pakistani indulgence is rife with multiple challenges. First of all, it would be rather difficult to fix the degree of state complicity in an attack within a severely limited time frame for any retaliatory operation. The Pakistan Army’s tolerance, if it indeed exists, and international community’s acceptance would be time-sensitive. Second, local commanders along the LoC on the Pakistani side could misread the ‘accepted threshold’ assumption and act differently than expected when attacked. Third, the Indian side would, as it did post-surgical strikes, radically exaggerate the success of its retaliatory strike in order to show that the Pakistani tolerance level for Indian retaliation is high. The Pakistani side would, on the other hand, as it did post-surgical strikes, deny the operation altogether or lower its level and success (i.e. that operation was limited to the LoC only) to reduce the perceived level of Pakistani tolerance by India. Finding a via media between these two extreme positions for operational purposes is easier said than done, and trying to exploit that fine balance may be setting out on a dangerous course of action. Finally, that there was no vertical escalation after the surgical strikes even though this was an openly declared attack on Pakistan’s territory assumes a great deal of significance. While this might, at one level, go to show that the Indian and Pakistani sides are able to control the escalation dynamics under extreme stress, it would be wrong to assume that India’s cross-LoC operation has gone not responded to by Pakistan. Indeed, the response is currently playing out. Consider the following. The low-cost response Responding to the surgical strikes with matching force would not have been a smart strategy for Pakistan given that it would have been hard for Rawalpindi to pull it off. This, in my reckoning, perhaps explains the Pakistani inaction and the refusal to acknowledge the Indian attack. When you don’t acknowledge an action, you don’t have to react to it. However, the story doesn’t end there. Pakistan is currently responding to the Indian strikes in a way it is materially able to and ‘at a time and place of its choosing’: by firing on the border and organising coordinated attacks on Indian Army bases\/convoys through its proxies such as the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. These two cheap strategies seem to essentially make up Rawalpindi’s response to New Delhi’s surgical strikes. India was highly emboldened by the Pakistan military’s non-retaliation after the September strikes but it is today recognising that while it may have pulled off the military action and the subsequent political management of it, the costs are mounting day after day. The LoC and the IB have become the new battlefield, and we should expect a lot more action along these borderlands in the days ahead. Both India and Pakistan seem to be using these contested borders as an arena for settling scores which they do not want to settle in a conventional pitched battle. In short, lower-level instability seems to be the order of the day in the near future. While border firing might seem less escalatory than cross-border raids, ceasefire violations are a slow killer: as ceasefire violation-related casualties continue to rise, they could lead to political and diplomatic escalation, and sustained violations together with covert cross-border raids (as it has happened more than once in the past) could potentially lead to vertical military escalation. The other cheap strategy in response to India’s surgical strikes seems to be well-planned low-intensity attacks on Indian forces in J&K. While border firing hurts both parties, low-intensity strikes (for example, Nagrota and Pampore) hurt only India since it loses soldiers in such raids, whereas Pakistan only loses expendable proxies. The argument here is not that such attacks against Army camps did not take place before September this year, but that they are likely to increase with more precision and determination in the days ahead. Moreover, thanks to the stand-off, Islamabad and Rawalpindi will continue to fan the Kashmir uprising with even more vigour. Notwithstanding the fact that the recent Kashmir uprising was essentially indigenous in nature, Pakistani grandstanding and renewed domestic political mobilisation within Pakistan over Kashmir, and the military strategising for a sustained Kashmir campaign will keep Kashmir on the boil. Pakistan’s adoption of such low-cost strategies to respond to India’s surgical strikes also lands the Modi government in a rather awkward commitment trap. Though the post-Uri strikes and the political posturing by the Bharatiya Janata Party were supposed to convey to Rawalpindi, and the domestic audience in India that attacks on Indian forces won’t go unpunished anymore, the reality is that both the Nagrota and Pampore attacks have gone unpunished. This leaves the Modi government in a strategic quandary: it has neither been able to live up to its commitment nor has its threats been able to dissuade the Pakistan Army. If anything, the Pakistan Army seems to have called the Modi government’s bluff. National security implications The current stand-off with Pakistan has drastically deteriorated our overall national security environment. Our soldiers in the north-western frontier are far more in danger today than they had been in recent years. The precious lives of soldiers would have been saved had New Delhi avoided an unnecessarily aggressive policy in J&K and towards Pakistan. There is also growing disquiet within the Indian armed forces about the needless loss of lives because politicians are unwilling to reach a modus vivendi on political issues both within Kashmir and vis-à-vis Pakistan. Besides the military casualties, there is yet another form of collateral damage: the lives and livelihoods of people living along the border. Despite the recurrent hardship that they have to go through, villagers don’t speak out in public thanks to the extreme levels of right-wing political mobilisation in Jammu. Suffering and death are couched in the language of deshbhakti (patriotism). In private, however, they recount the untold miseries due to ceasefire violations. The year-long violations in 2014, for instance, had displaced them for several months. This is a collateral damage that goes unsung and unacknowledged.

THIS IS the text of an appeal issued by nine leading nuclear scientists, all former heads of nuclear-related organisations, on the eve of Independence Day: While the nation and Parliament discuss the Indo-U. S. nuclear deal from various angles, we feel it is our responsibility to place before the nation our well-considered views on the impact of this deal on the future of Indian nuclear science and technology, and its effects on the energy security of the nation. We have all worked in the field of atomic energy from the very early years after India's independence. From very small beginnings, we have now reached a stage where we are in possession of all the technologies needed for the production of electricity from indigenous nuclear minerals, and have successfully applied these technologies in diverse sectors from health, agriculture and industry to national and energy security. All this has been possible with the support of the people represented in the government through Parliament, and the outstanding statesmen who have guided and supported our plans. We therefore feel it is our obligation to make public our perceptions for the effective and continued nurturing and utilisation of this technology in the country. Science is universal. Knowledge can be created in any part of the world, and technology comes with experimentation and the willingness to take risks. We have followed all these paths to reach the present stage of development. We are amongst the most advanced countries in the technology of fast-breeder reactors, which is crucial to the future of our energy security. Along the way we have derived benefits from international collaboration. At the same time, we have also shared some of our abilities in this field with the world. Indian scientists have been ambassadors, with knowledge and creativity as their tools. It is of prime importance to uphold these cherished traditions. It is significant that the most advanced country in nuclear science and technology has come forward to accept us into the international nuclear community, by the historic document signed by our Prime Minister with President Bush on 18th July, 2005. The basic principles for cooperation were well laid out in this bilateral understanding and the Prime Minister has apprised our Parliament of this. No doubt it needs the concurrence of the other nations comprising the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Based on this agreement, the U.S. lawmakers and the administration are in the process of re-framing their laws, which could change the nature of relations between the two countries. This is a most welcome initiative of the UPA government, and is a continuation of the process essentially begun during the previous NDA government. Thus, there is no question of any political partisanship on this matter. However, the lawmakers of the U.S. Congress have modified, both in letter and spirit, the implementation of such an agreement. At this juncture, among other aspects, it is essential that we insist on the following four central themes: 1. India should continue to be able to hold on to her nuclear option as a strategic requirement in the real world that we live in, and in the ever-changing complexity of the international political system. This means that we cannot accede to any restraint in perpetuity on our freedom of action. We have not done this for the last forty years after the Non-Proliferation Treaty came into being, and there is no reason why we should succumb to this now. Universal nuclear disarmament must be our ultimate aim, and until we see the light at the end of the tunnel on this important issue, we cannot accept any agreement in perpetuity.2. After 1974, when the major powers discontinued cooperation with us, we have built up our capability in many sensitive technological areas, which need not and should not now be subjected to external control. Safeguards are understandable where external assistance for nuclear materials or technologies are involved. We have agreed to this before, and we can continue to agree to this in the future too, but strictly restricted to those facilities and materials imported from external sources.3. We find that the Indo-U.S. deal, in the form approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, infringes on our independence for carrying out indigenous research and development (R&D) in nuclear science and technology. Our R&D should not be hampered by external supervision or control, or by the need to satisfy any international body. Research and technology development are the sovereign rights of any nation. This is especially true when they concern strategic national defence and energy self-sufficiency. 4. While the sequence of actions to implement the cooperation could be left for discussion between the two governments, the basic principles on which such actions will rest is the right of Parliament and the people to decide. The Prime Minister has already taken up with President Bush the issue of the new clauses recommended by the U.S. House of Representatives. If the U.S. Congress, in its wisdom, passes the bill in its present form, the `product' will become unacceptable to India, and, diplomatically, it will be very difficult to change it later. Hence it is important for our Parliament to work out, and insist on, the ground rules for the nuclear deal, at this stage itself. We therefore request you, the Parliamentarians, to discuss this deal and arrive at a unanimous decision, recognising the fundamental facts of India's indigenous nuclear science and technology achievements to date, the efforts made to overcome the unfair restrictions placed on us and the imaginative policies and planning enunciated and followed in the years after Independence. The nation, at this critical juncture, depends on its representatives in Parliament to ensure that decisions taken today do not inhibit our future ability to develop and pursue nuclear technologies for the benefit of the nation.

{"url":"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/979776\/letters","text":"PUBLISHED : Thursday, 22 September, 2011, 12:00am Letters | South China Morning Post ESF - English Schools Foundation ESF - English Schools Foundation ESF parents have limited options How ironic that Cynthia Sze accuses those of us writing to remove discrimination in terms of fees against pupils attending ESF schools of writing 'without regard to relevant facts and their moral significance' ('ESF must accept level playing field', September 15). She states that 35 per cent of English Schools Foundation places are occupied not by non-permanent residents but rather by 'non-residents'. She says that 'English is the medium of instruction of many local schools' (many is a term which ordinarily is taken to mean a significantly plural number). As I stated in my letter ('ESF fills role government should play', September 2), when my Hong Kong-born daughter reached school age there was only one local school available in our school district for her, which was neither secular nor co-educational. The Basic Law states that English and Cantonese are official languages. Yet, English speakers continue to be discriminated against, firstly with regard to access to non-ESF local schools and again with the lower level of subsidy per pupil at ESF schools. If English standards continue to decline in Hong Kong, as Ms Sze accepts, this is most unlikely to result in the rest of the world abandoning English as the primary international business language. Richard Di Bona, Mid-Levels Local schools snub some taxpayers Cynthia Sze ('ESF must accept level playing field', September 15) has written several anti-ESF letters, parts of which could be agreed with but for two basic facts which she seems to have overlooked. She makes continual reference to 'selective non-residents'. Anyone who comes to Hong Kong to work is immediately a resident (albeit not a permanent one) and is entitled as a taxpayer to the same health and education subsidies as anyone else living here. There is no such thing as a non-resident attending a local school of any description. I am sure she would complain most vociferously if she were to be given a work contract for Britain, have to pay taxes and then be told her children could not attend a local school there or get National Health Service treatment; so this is reciprocal. It should be noted that few people in Hong Kong pay any tax at all and expatriate workers are one of the groups that pay tax as their salaries must be ample enough to be granted visas in the first place. The second fact which she refuses to take on board is that few Hong Kong schools, even the English medium of instruction ones, will accept non-local students as they do not speak Cantonese. Hong Kong is light years away from providing the sort of language education afforded to non-English speakers in English-speaking countries. I am sure countless parents would ditch the ESF at the first possible chance if places were available at local schools. Why does Ms Sze not use her energy to get local schools to accept non-Chinese students? That way, her hated ESF would soon die off for lack of demand for places. Sam Gregory, Shau Kei Wan No fond memories of zoo visits I would like to dispute Ocean Park chief executive Tom Merhmann's claim that 'seeing living, breathing animals up close promotes a strong personal connection between the animals and the 700 million people who visit zoos and aquariums annually' ('Sea change for Ocean Park?', September 19). I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s, but being taken to circuses to watch captive tigers, bears, monkeys and elephants perform tricks certainly created no 'strong personal connection' between me and them. Nor have the many, many visits to zoos and aquariums in various places around the world through my childhood. What it did start to make me realise, over the years, was how wrong the entire notion of capturing animals for our personal entertainment is. My own 'strong personal connection' and empathy for animal rights comes not from zoos, aquariums and circuses - unless Mr Merhmann would like to consider negative reinforcement as a motivator - but from being able to now watch the most incredible documentaries on multiple wildlife channels, 24\/7. These same channels make zoos and aquariums entirely redundant. Yes, we need scientific research to help wild animal populations survive. But let's stop kidding ourselves - Resorts World Sentosa-style - that using wild animals as entertainment to line a company's pockets is somehow some kind of philanthropic gesture. It demeans us all. Suzanne Miao, Kennedy Town Doubts about growth of free papers Hong Kong has a varied selection of free newspapers and the latest one to hit the streets is Sharp Daily. Given that there is no charge, these papers can certainly save citizens a lot of money. You might spend between HK$40 and HK$50 a week on paid papers. More of these free publications are being launched, however, and I wonder if they are really suitable. They contain countless advertisements often at the expense of news and business stories. If you relied on a free paper to acquire all the information you needed about what was happening here and internationally, you would not find much and what you could read would not be detailed. As I said, some pages are full of adverts and there have been some complaints of 'indecent content'. This could have a negative effect on young people and I do not think their written language or critical thinking skills will be helped by reading these free newspapers. I hope all citizens, especially youngsters, will consider the core value of newspapers, that they have a responsibility to report honestly and comprehensively the news from all over the world. What we require is detailed information about what is happening. Keith Cheng, Sheung Shui Extravagant excess has fuelled anger Holden Chow, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong's (DAB) youth wing, is shocked by the violence of recent protests ('Violent protests are sending wrong message to our younger generation', September 17). His letter drew attention to the recent riots in London. The scale of violence in Hong Kong and London simply cannot be compared, but there are perhaps some similarities for the staunchly pro-government DAB to ponder. Most participants were disaffected youths whose employment prospects are low and declining, who can see that upper echelons of society are milking the system for extravagant excess. For British politicians' perks and investment bankers' bonuses read Hong Kong's civil servants' deferred benefits and tycoon developers' blatant greed. The procrastination of government in dealing with worsening poverty and its arrogance in handling public consultations are reasons that protests are becoming more vigorous. Nothing inflames protesters more than officials turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to genuine livelihood problems while giving full attention to the vested interests of the elite. As the DAB is reputedly a 'grass-roots' political party, I'm surprised that Holden Chow is not connecting the dots. J. F. Kay, Lai Chi Kok Unimpressed by chief executives Hong Kong will have a new chief executive next year. Hongkongers have accepted that the election process is just a fa?ade. It will all come down to what Beijing wants. Looking back, I believe the first chief executive of the SAR showed heart and sincerity towards the Hong Kong people. I don't think his successor cares and they have both been inept. The job is made more difficult because of the ideological differences between Beijing and Hong Kong. Both chief executives became highly unpopular with Hong Kong citizens, but to the central government that was irrelevant. Its priority is to see social harmony here. But the painful lesson to learn from the first two chief executives is that social harmony is disintegrating. Therefore, Hong Kong needs its next chief executive to be a proven decision-maker, and someone who is willing to make those decisions even if they are unpopular. He, or she, must also address the serious problems of poverty, inflation and housing. Tony Yuen, Mid-Levels url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/979776\/letters"}

Their comments, made during a small group discussion among Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference delegates in Beijing, came as the autonomous region's governor said yesterday that there 'won't be any big problem' this year in the predominantly Buddhist area. Qiangba Puncog said on the sidelines of the National People's Congress that the situation in Tibet was stable, despite reports that several protests had broken out in some Tibetan-populated areas in the run-up to March 10, the 50th anniversary of an uprising that saw the Dalai Lama flee to India. He denied there was a blanket ban on foreign tourists and journalists travelling to the region, but said 'necessary' measures were in place to restrict foreign tourists in the interests of social stability. 'We are very confident in ensuring economic growth, safeguarding social welfare and ensuring stability.' But local officials suggested the central government had to come up with a more sustainable plan for Tibet's long-term social stability. Yunnan religious affairs bureau chief Xiong Shengxiang said Beijing should trust local Tibetan officials. Mr Xiong said most Han Chinese officials had limited experience in handling ethnic-minority issues and so lacked the sensibility needed to deal with those communities. 'The government should step up efforts to train ethnic-minority cadres,' he said, adding that a lack of a support for ethnicity minorities and desire to listen to them had led to misunderstandings. For example, he said Tibetan monks living in remote mountains where electricity supply and transport were limited had difficulty understanding government policy because of a lack of access to information. 'We should avoid just curing the head when we have a headache, and curing the foot when we have foot pain,' he said, citing a saying that things should be dealt with systematically rather than superficially. Acheng, a retired Sichuan CPPCC chairman, said the government should let religious figures rather than officials handle violations of religious practice and doctrines. 'The public won't understand [government decisions] that are against the constitutional regulations on religious freedom and won't be supportive,' he said. 'Lately, much of the publicity has focused too much on anti-separatism and less on unity.' Beijing has been under pressure over its crackdown on Tibetan protesters involved in rioting last year. Critics say the protests were partly due to hardline policies, with lamas bearing the brunt of restrictions on religious practice. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/672240\/put-more-trust-tibetan-officials-and-listen-locals-delegates-urge"}

But try to remember him. He is a perfect example of why we need to cleanse the rot from our political system. He is one of those who best exemplify that rot. He proved that once again last week. Razack is a legislator who got 'elected' through the despised functional constituency system. It is despised by the majority of Hongkongers because it only allows a tiny minority of privileged people to vote. Razack represents the real estate constituency in Legco. He makes no bones about advancing the interests of property tycoons even if that hurts the majority of Hong Kong people. Last week, legislators from all political parties joined in a rare show of unity to support a non-binding motion demanding tougher rules against the unscrupulous practices of property developers. But Razack scoffed at the motion. He alone voted to support the tycoons rather than the people who are being squeezed by them. He used the rot in the system to give the people the finger. But Public Eye would still like to thank Razack. We would like to thank him for reminding us all why the majority of people so despise the functional constituency system. He reminded us it is a system created to advance the interests of the privileged at the expense of the common people. From public payroll to developers' mouthpiece Public Eye would like to note that before Abraham Razack moved on to represent the property developers in Legco he headed the Land Development Corporation, now renamed the Urban Renewal Authority, which has close ties to our developers. You might want to ask yourself whether it is morally right for someone who was paid by the public to represent the people's interests in joint urban renewal projects with developers to then switch sides and represent the developers in Legco. Government pollster still playing catch-up Remember Professor Lau Siu-kai, the government pollster who heads the secretive Central Policy Unit, the one who lives on cloud-cuckoo-land? We told you about him a couple of weeks ago. Yes, he's the fellow who assured his government bosses the July 1, 2003, protest march would draw mere thousands, not the half a million that actually turned up. Apparently, Lau has been busy doing more of his internal polls to feel the pulse of the people. He's made the astonishing discovery that most Hongkongers oppose the so-called referendum on democracy. OK, OK, it's not astonishing. Other pollsters have long concluded that already. But don't bother asking Lau why he waited till last week to tell us something we already know. He's suffering from a memory lapse. He says he can't remember exactly how many polls he's conducted on the issue or over what time period. But what the heck, it's just the public's money. And in cloud-cuckoo-land there are no rules saying you must tell the people how, why and when you spend their money. Belgian ban will floor Batman Public Eye calls on Belgium to reconsider being the first European country to effectively ban the Muslim veil by outlawing clothes that prevent the wearer from being identified. We ask Belgians to back off out of concern for their own safety. Supposing the crime rate shoots up. Belgians would need to call on Batman. But the ban would require the Caped Crusader to remove his hood before going after the bad guys. There's no way he would agree to have his cover blown. And then there's Halloween to consider. What would Halloween be like minus the scary mask from the hit Scream movie series? But even if the Belgians refuse to budge, Muslim women can still beat the ban by wearing specially-designed black surgical face masks. If challenged by the authorities they can simply say they don't want to spread their germs around. Sick people in Hong Kong wear face masks all the time. Our government actually encourages it. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/713372\/public-eye"}

The letter, received by a newspaper last Friday, stated that its author was not happy with Mr Tung's running of Hong Kong and urged him not to seek a second term. Signed 'Hong Kong bin Laden', it also said the author was not happy with the work of Mr Tung's two top officials, Chief Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen and Financial Secretary Antony Leung Kam-chung, whom it also threatened to poison, a police source said last night. Police declined to elaborate on the letter's content but said it had no bearing on any terrorist-related activity. The newspaper reported the letter to police and handed it to the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau. Police said the man, 44, and his wife, 32, owned a hair-dressing salon in Central. They were arrested in connection with a case of criminal intimidation. Officers from the bureau had to force open the main door to the salon, which was closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival. The man put up a struggle but was quickly subdued. A computer, printer, computer disks, envelopes and soil samples from plants were removed for analysis. The couple were later escorted back to their flat in Aberdeen, where police also seized several bags of items.

{"url":"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/705214\/greater-autonomy-tibet-ruled-out","text":"Greater autonomy for Tibet ruled out PUBLISHED : Tuesday, 02 February, 2010, 12:00am Tibet Beijing bluntly ruled out any possibility of a 'greater Tibet' or further autonomy in the Himalayan region as the Dalai Lama's envoys returned to India yesterday after seemingly futile closed-door negotiations in Beijing. Du Qinglin, head of the Communist Party Central Committee's United Front Work Department, told the envoys in Beijing at the weekend that 'complete abandonment' of the idea of 'greater Tibet and 'meaningful autonomy' were the prerequisites of further negotiations, Xinhua reported yesterday. The Dalai Lama's envoys - US-based Lodi Gyari and Swiss-based Kelsang Gyaltsen - had been in Beijing for two days of talks with officials from Du's department. 'They returned to India today [Monday] after the negotiations in Beijing,' the Dalai Lama's spokesman, Tenzin Taklha, said. But he refused to comment on the talks, the ninth round since 2002. The dialogue broke off 15 months ago because of a proposal submitted by the Dalai Lama's envoys that called for a 'greater Tibet', which would combine four additional Tibetan-populated mainland provinces and the Tibet Autonomous Region . Du's remarks were yet another refusal of the Dalai Lama's calls for greater autonomy in 'greater Tibet', which Beijing considers 'separatist'. 'There is no room for negotiation on the issues of sovereignty and territory; there won't be any room for compromise,' Du told the envoys. 'The constitutional principles should not be abused, and the so-called 'greater Tibet' and 'high-degree autonomy' are against the constitution. Only when [the Dalai Lama] completely gives up [these ideas] will the negotiations have a foundation, and the Dalai Lama will have a future.' 'High-degree' autonomy, similar to the model being practised in Hong Kong and Macau, is one of the ideas the Dalai Lama has proposed to champion his calls for 'meaningful autonomy' in greater Tibet. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate denies he wants to separate Tibet from China. Du added that negotiations would yield no progress if the Dalai Lama continued his 'international anti-China campaign and sabotaging activities'. The Dalai Lama is expected to meet US President Barack Obama in Washington this month. Although Beijing has repeatedly rejected the proposal of a 'greater Tibet', it recently included Tibetan-populated areas in four other provinces - Yunnan, Gansu, Qinghai and Sichuan - for the first time in a blueprint for the region's economic development. Xinhua said Du had briefed the envoys on the development plan for Tibet and China's economic recovery from the global financial crisis. Wang Zuoan, director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, told a national conference of the Buddhist Association of China yesterday that Tibetan monks and nuns should be instilled with more nationalistic education. '[They should] absolutely oppose and voluntarily boycott separatist activities and attempts to destabilise society by the Dalai clique in the name of religion,' Wang said. Beijing launched a campaign to 'educate' Tibetan monks and nuns after unrest rocked Tibetan-populated areas in March 2008. In the campaign, the monks are required to denounce the Dalai Lama. In the latest issue of Qiushi magazine, Wang wrote that religious affairs in China were getting more complicated because of increased interference from 'foreign forces'. 'As the number of religious followers increases continuously, the social influence of religions has expanded,' he wrote. 'Interference by foreign forces in the name of religion has not only never stopped, but has intensified.' Dr Chan Kim-kwong, an expert on mainland religious affairs from the Hong Kong Christian Council, said Wang's article was rare acknowledgement of the challenges facing mainland religious affairs. 'It's still too early to say if this article means tighter controls on religious practice, but Wang was probably trying to ask for more government resources,' he said. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/705214\/greater-autonomy-tibet-ruled-out"}

The money will allow the government's contractors to dismantle the pier and store the pieces for reconstruction on a site still to be determined in a public consultation. Before the vote, officials refused to disclose when the contractors would begin dismantling the pier, on the grounds that they still had to map out the demolition and storage plan. Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands Michael Suen Ming-yeung promised legislators, after repeated demands from pan-democrats, to inform the relevant Legco panels and the Central and Western District Council of the plan before the bulldozers moved in. 'The government has been working with various organisations on how to preserve the pier since early this year,' Mr Suen said. 'We organised many forums to listen to the people's views. The majority of people we have consulted agree with our conservation plan.' Mr Suen's initial reluctance to inform Legco on the demolition plan prompted Civic Party legislator Audrey Eu Yuet-mee to call him 'sneaky'. The Frontier legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing, the committee's chairwoman said: 'He is an eel, [because] it is impossible to catch.' Mr Suen assured legislators that the government would take good care of the pier's dismantled pieces, which would be housed in temporary storage either in Kai Tak or Tseung Kwan O. The government's antiquities advisers would not be informed about the demolition plan because they did not have a role on the matter, according to the Permanent Secretary for Home Affairs, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. The Antiquities Advisory Board awarded the pier Grade I historic status on May 8, but Secretary for Home Affairs Patrick Ho Chi-ping decided the pier did not possess the qualities required for being declared a monument. Last month he told legislators that the Antiquities and Monuments Office, a statutory body, had advised him that the pier's 'historical value was not of such significance to qualify it as a monument'. The pier, landing place of British governors and royalty, has been the subject of intense controversy after the demolition of its neighbour, the former Star Ferry pier, on December 16. The pier will be demolished to make way for a new stretch of expressway. A group of conservationists has been camping at the pier for nearly two months, in protest at its proposed demolition. url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/596928\/legco-gives-green-light-demolition-queens-pier"}

Leung vows justice for Manila bus hostage victims Chief executive defends slow progress in talks over Manila victims PUBLISHED : Monday, 19 August, 2013, 12:00am CY Leung touts messages from ‘two sessions’ in Beijing at seminar 10 Apr 2018 The chief executive promised yesterday to use all means possible to fight for justice for victims of the Manila bus hostage tragedy almost three years ago. Leung Chun-ying's second meet-the-public session, in Kwun Tong, was a much quieter affair than his first one last week, when he caused uproar in some quarters by expressing support for the police's handling of a protest in Mong Kok at which rival groups clashed over a teacher's verbal attack on officers. This time he kept his opening remarks short and apolitical, simply addressing the district's opportunities and difficulties. Pro-government allies were dominant in the audience of 280, with only a dozen people from the pro-democratic People Power managing to get in. The event in Kwun Tong Kung Lok Government School was largely peaceful, although there were minor clashes between the two camps before Leung entered and at the end. Inquiries raised by the public yesterday mainly focused on local livelihood issues. But Tse Chi-kin, brother of tour guide Masa Tse Ting-chunn who was killed in the hostage tragedy, questioned Leung on his progress in dealing with the aftermath of the shooting. \"Taiwan spent only three months to demand an official apology from the Philippines [for the fatal shooting of a Taiwanese fisherman],\" Tse said. \"Why has the Hong Kong government failed to do so after three whole years?\" Later, Democrat Donna Yau Yuet-wah echoed Tse in saying Leung failed to turn his words and promises into action. Leung said he would never forget the tragedy and vowed to fight for justice for the victims and their relatives. \"The government has met the Philippine consulate 23 times since 2012 and the latest meeting took place just last Monday,\" Leung said. Tse is seeking a formal apology and compensation from Manila over the deaths of his brother and seven Hong Kong tourists, who died when their bus was hijacked by disgruntled former policeman Rolando Mendoza.

The comment counters the suggestion of a panel of scholars which had recommended that full support from student representatives was required for initiating such reviews. The panel was tasked to assess the university’s governance structure . The HKU governing council’s working party released its report on the panel’s recommendations on Tuesday night, indicating that it would engage students, but stating that their full support on such matters pertaining to discipline was not necessary. The party also rejected suggestions to scrap the default arrangement of the city’s chief executive as the university’s chancellor, or to strip his power to appoint the chairperson of the council and approve honorary degrees. The controversial issue has previously led to violent disruptions at the council’s meetings last year. “It’s simply impossible if full support [of student representatives] is needed to discipline other students,” said a member of the working party who asked to remain anonymous as he was not authorised to speak on behalf of the group. Regarding ways in which students will be engaged, the member mentioned possible examples such as public consultations. He added: “There are many ways to handle violent actions in criminal activities and I think the most radical time has passed.” According to a university statute, its disciplinary committee will investigate if a student is alleged to have committed assault or battery against any member, or wilful damage to any property of the university, and decide on penalties from reprimand to expulsion for those found guilty. However, the review panel was told that the terms are insufficient – and do not extend to non-students – to consider the behaviours of individuals in the violent episodes of disruption at council meetings. In January 2016, hundreds of students and protesters broke into a council meeting, some jumping on tables, and blocking the exit of members. They were calling for reforms to the chancellorship arrangement. Billy Fung Jing-en, a student leader , was arrested and tried over charges of criminal intimidation, criminal damage and attempted forcible entry. The review panel suggested that extending the disciplinary code would allow the university to handle a wider range of less serious incidents internally, so that students would be less likely to earn a criminal record. Mak Tung-wing, deputy convenor of HKU Alumni Concern Group, said he agreed with the panel’s recommendations because the disciplinary committee statutes were introduced to the university’s ordinance with full support of five student representatives back in the 1970s. He said that if the code was to be reviewed, the discussion and persuasion process would make all stakeholders better understand limits of actions on campus. “More conflicts are expected in the coming two to three years,” Mak said. “Handling disturbances on campus by people who are more familiar with the school and that are specialised in dealing with students, are in principle, better than calling in the police – a move which has long been considered high-handed.” But the source from the working party said they did not spend much time discussing the need to extend the code when they went through the 53-page report. A spokeswoman said the university has no comment on whether there was a plan to review the disciplinary code.

One militant was arrested. A senior police officer said that, based on a tip—off, they launched an operation to nab top militants reported to be hiding in Dachan areas, about 270 km north—east of Jammu. “We launched an operation today (Monday) morning by throwing a cordon around the area. As we closed in on the hideout of the militants, a fire fight began that continued for over an hour,” he said. According to reports, two militants have been shot dead in the encounter. “One of them is Amir Ali Kamal, code name Akram, who was prime accused in the Delhi High Court blast,” the officer said. Akram was on the radar of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as he is believed to have arranged explosives and planter for the blast. The other person killed was identified as Shafi. Both of them belong to the Hizb—ul—Mujahideen outfit, the officer added. Akram was one of the most wanted militants due to his involvement in many crimes and terror activities. He is an accused in the Delhi High Court blast of Sep 7, 2011 in which at least 10 people were killed and over 70 injured. The NIA wanted to catch Akram alive as he could provide clues in resolving the blast case. Therefore, he was being tracked through various sources and conduits. According to police sources, there was intelligence input that a group of seven militants, including Jehangir (top Commander of HM of the area), Shakir Hussain Sheikh alias Chota Hafiz (HM district commander), Riaz, Rizwan and Shafi along with two other associates, were holding a meeting to strategise plans for future action. The security forces struck in the morning when this meeting was going on. According to these sources, Akram (aka Amir Ali Kamal) and Shafi were killed.

The first blast occurred just near the Nalbari Police Station in the heart of the town around 10 a.m., injuring several people. As a huge crowd of market-goers gathered to help the injured and to witness the blast after-effects, another powerful blast occurred soon a few feet away from the first blast site. Five people died on the spot in the second blast and over 50 were injured, several critically. Two people died later in hospitals here. About 30 seriously injured were admitted to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and other hospitals. Police suspect that the blasts were the handiwork of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA). However, a caller, identifying himself as self-styled commander of the ULFA’s 709 Battalion Hira Sarania, told three local television news channels that the outfit was not involved in the blasts. The caller alleged that the blasts could be the handiwork of vested interests to sabotage a fresh move by the People’s Committee for Peace Initiative in Assam (PCPIA), a conglomerate of civil society groups for brokering peace dialogue between the ULFA and the government. A PCPIA delegation is now camping in New Delhi to impress upon the Union government to initiate the stalled peace process with the ULFA. A senior police officer, who declined to be quoted on the ground that investigations were still on, told The Hindu that whether the ULFA denied it or not, the police suspected the twin blasts to be the handiwork of the militant outfit. “Two improvised bicycle-bombs were triggered by the ULFA. In the past too, we had recovered similar bicycle-bombs of the ULFA. After triggering the blasts in a public place, the ULFA is in a denial mode, fearing public outcry against it,” he said. The police also suspect that the ULFA was desperate to show its strength following the arrest of its self-styled foreign secretary Sashadhar Choudhury and finance secretary Chitraban Hazarika in Dhaka, now in custody of the Assam police. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/7-killed-55-injured-in-two-Assam-bomb-blasts\/article16481557.ece"}

The top brass of the State intelligence unit met their city police counterparts recently and topics related to security lacunae were apparently one of the key subjects discussed. Regular exchange of information between the two agencies in future was also agreed upon. Hopefully, the alertness and anti-sabotage measures put in place by the enforcement agencies to ensure security in Chennai will continue uninterrupted. But it is upto every citizen in the city to remain extra vigilant and be aware of the possible threats around. Soon after the heat and dust of the twin blasts settled, city policemen worked overtime to step up security arrangements all over the city and schools were among the most important establishments under the scanner. Senior police officials interacted with school heads. Policemen issued a list of instructions to school managements, the most important among them being measures to monitor the movement of children and those accompanying them. The other major recommendation was for school authorities to keep a watch on the crew of vehicles which pick up and drop children. “Installation of surveillance cameras has become mandatory to keep a track of the movement of people around school premises. CCTV footage helped in rescuing a boy kidnapped last year by a person who pretended to his van driver,” said a police inspector in South Chennai, in whose jurisdiction are more than a dozen top-listed schools. School managements can no longer shun the responsibility of students’ safety, even outside their premises. They have to make sure that only parents, close relatives or trusted domestic helps drop children. They also have to ensure that drivers and attendants of vehicles have a valid address. However, the headmistress of a CBSE school in the suburbs said she had not received any communication on this meeting. She however said private schools were doing everything within their resources to ensure that students’ safety remained a priority.

On Friday, a Tis Hazari court granted a transit remand for producing him in an Allahabad court within two days, but sent him to the Tihar Central Jail here in view of security concerns. The court directed the Jail Superintendent and the Deputy Commissioner of the Delhi police (3rd Battalion) to produce him before an Allahabad court. Karnal Singh, Joint Commissioner, Delhi police (Special Cell), said that following a tip-off that Ahmed would come to Ghalib Apartment on Parwana Road to meet some persons, a police team intercepted the vehicle in he was travelling.

After that, nine cases on various charges were registered against him. It is learnt that after he went underground, Ahmed visited Mumbai and Faridabad before coming to the capital where he changed several hideouts. According to the Delhi police, he was previously involved in 38 criminal cases, including murder, attempt-to-murder, extortion, kidnapping, rioting and under the Arms Act and the Gangsters Act in Uttar Pradesh. In 1995, he was allegedly involved in the murder of an undertrial Akhtar on the Allahabad High Court premises.

Mani. LDF MLAs, other representatives of the people, and LDF leaders from the district took part in the dharna. Inaugurating the dharna, State secretary of the Communist Party of India C.K. Chandrappan said the United Democratic Front (UDF) government seemed to have declared a war on the people through its revised Budget. There should be a mass movement cutting across political divide to effectively counter the challenges posed by the Budget, he said. Mr. Chandrappan said the proposals in the revised budget had triggered widespread protests all over the State. It not only lacked clarity but had even torpedoed the declared policies of the UDF. He said the budget had failed to grasp the problems of the State. The issue of food security and price control had not been addressed. Even the Onam mela centres had virtually no stock of essential commodities. Addressing the dharna, the former Education Minister and Kundara MLA M.A.. Baby said the revised Budget had drawn a unprecedented wave of protests. Even the ruling side had expressed its reservation and the UDF was forced to call a meeting to discuss the issues pertaining to the budget. The former Minister for Water Resources N.K. Premachandran said the cashew processing sector had been completely ignored in the budget. He alleged that the provision to exempt cashew plantations from the purview of land reforms was intended to help the private sector retain excess land. All proposals for road renovation and development in the last Budget of the previous LDF government had been deleted. The former Agriculture Minister and Chadayamangalam MLA Mullakara Ratnakaran said though Mr. Mani was well experienced in preparation of budget proposals, the revised budget had not gone much beyond Kottayam district. The budget lacked a justified distribution. Kollam had been totally ignored ostensibly because the district had largely stood by the LDF in the last Assembly elections, he alleged.

Srinu and his associate, Niranjan, both of whom were accused of planning to create disturbances in Madannapet to foster unity among Hindus, are still at large, while four Hindu youngsters allegedly involved in the temple desecration were already arrested. As per the plan, Srinu purchased blue paint from a shop in Champapet and kept it ready at a tree near Sree Rama Bhakta Samajam office in Kurmaguda. Active in area He asked the four youngsters to collect the paint from there which was sprinkled on the doors of the temple. Investigators said that Srinu was actively involved in organising religious events in and around Kurmaguda of Madannapet. “Srinu didn't confine himself to participation in religious programmes. He would help individuals in any personal work like going to a government office to apply for some certificates or schemes and thus developed good network,” the police said. He and Niranjan disappeared soon after police started cracking down on persons responsible for the communal clashes. Initially, investigators suspected that Srinu and Niranjan hatched the plot to trigger communal disturbances to enhance their image and fight for supremacy among some Hindu leaders in the locality. However, later it was found that they had no dispute with the leaders and were instrumental in securing win for BJP candidate Sahadev Yadav as Kurmaguda corporator.

Led by the Radhapuram union secretary of Tamil Nadu Nadar Paeravai, Senthil Murugan, the palmyrah workers and the supporters of Akhila India Samaththuva Makkal Katchi took out a rally from Kalvilai to the nearby palmgrove and tapped toddy. Raising slogans against the State Government’s ban on toddy tapping, which was later upheld by the Supreme Court, some protestors drank toddy and certified that it was only a health drink with insignificant alcohol content and not an alcoholic beverage like the brew being sold in the IMFL outlets of the State Government. Similarly, some palmyrah farmers tapped toddy at Pattankaadu even as the police arrested 517 protestors, including 66 women, in the neighbouring town of Vasudevanallur. The police also arrested 79 persons at Surandai and 80 others at Paavoorchathram when they tried to tap toddy. Virudhunagar Hundreds of members of the Tamil Nadu Nadar Peravai and a few cadres of All India Moovendar Munnani Kazhagam were arrested at different places in the district on Wednesday when they proceeded to tap toddy. All those arrested were released later in the day. At Virudhunagar, the peravai’s district president, K.G.N. Kanagarathinam, who led the protest, flayed the successive State governments which promised to allow toddy tapping before elections and reversed their decision after coming to power. “When toddy tapping is allowed by the governments in the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Union territory of Puducherry, why is it not permitted in Tamil Nadu alone,” Mr. Kanagarathinam asked. He wondered what the prohibition policy of the State Government was that permitted sale of Indian-made foreign liquor through TASMAC shops, but banned toddy tapping. “Toddy has less alcohol content when compared to IMFL. Either, the Government should impose total prohibition by closing all TASMAC shops or allow tapping of toddy,” he said. A huge posse of policemen present at the venue prevented the peravai members from taking out a procession to a nearby palm groove to tap toddy. Protests were held at various places in and around Srivilliputtur taluk. An effigy of Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president, K.V. Thangakabalu was burnt near the Mariamman Teppakulam near here by three cadres of the peravai, the police said. Ramanathapuram More than 2000 persons, including 949 women, were arrested on Wednesday when they attempted to tap toddy at various places in the district. They were demanding the government to permit toddy tapping. In most of the places, the police prevented their attempt when they assembled for the agitation. In Paramakudi, 422 persons were arrested, including Muniasamy, president, Tamil Nadu Palm Tree Workers Association.

Goverdhan Reddy and others said the march was a success despite the hurdles created by the government. Protagonists reached Hyderabad by evading arrests, he added. Meanwhile, pro-Telangana activists under the banner of Telangana Joint Action Committee formed a human chain and took the oath. The agitators demanded a Bill in Parliament to carve out Telangana State. Not many from Adilabad district managed to reach the State capital due to the preventive arrests made by the police during the last three days. In all, about 150 activists proceeding towards Hyderabad were detained by police on Thursday morning. Attempts Karimnagar Staff Reporter adds: The district police foiled the attempts made by the TRS and pro-Telangana activists to proceed and participate in ‘Million March' in Hyderabad on Thursday with their arrests on various routes proceeding to the capital.

The police rounded up around 300 leaders and protagonists and registered 43 cases against them. Preventive arrests were made a couple of days before the ‘D-Day'. Since two passenger trains were cancelled, engaging of private vehicles were restricted and each vehicle was thoroughly checked at all check-posts along the National Highway-7 many activists decided to give the march a miss.

The police believe that Renjith was killed in retaliation to the murder of Communist Party of India (Marxist) activist Vanchiyoor Vishnu this April. They said the wanted men had been close associates of Vishnu and the group was involved, among other things, in the lucrative business of selling mud to realtors reclaiming wetlands for construction. Suresh and Krishnakumar, along with absconding ‘gang leader’ Om Prakash, are also accused in the killing of alleged mobster ‘Aprani’ Krishnakumar in 2007. Suresh was named as accused in the murder of ‘Changidi’ Vinod, an associate of Aprani Krishnakumar, in 2006. Hariprasad and Krishnakumar are the main suspects in the retaliatory attack on RSS activist Mohanan in the aftermath of Vishnu’s murder. The police said that some of the suspects were seen partying in front of the CPI (M) office at Vanchiyoor on the previous day of Renjith’s murder. A close relative of Vishnu was also present. The police have posted men in front of the office, the regular hangout of the main suspects in Renjith murder case, to prevent any retaliatory attack by RSS men. They said RSS cadres close to Renjith could retaliate against two top CPM leaders in the district if they suspected that the police were not doing enough to solve the murder. They said the suspects had initially planned to kill ‘Kakotta’ Manoj, one of the main accused in the Vishnu murder case. But he proved to be too elusive for the assailants. The police said Renjith’s killers arrived in front of his shop in two cars and one motorbike. They said a local contact helped the assailants. Investigators counted 49 injuries on Renjith’s body, an indication that there were more than five assailants. The police suspect that the conspiracy to kill Renjith was hatched at Muttathara and airport area. They are investigating an airport-based gang leader and CPI(M) functionary in connection with the murder conspiracy. Some of Vishnu’s associates had switched off their cell phones on October 16 and switched them on only after Renjith was killed. Investigators are viewing this action as a possible indication of their guilt. The police also searched the houses of one Deepu Dutt and his brother Balu Dutt near Muttathara for some suspects. They said the brothers had been arrested this year at Kovalam along with Krishnakumar and Karate Suresh on the charge of violating the Arms Act. The police also searched several premises in Mysore believing that Suresh could be hiding there. The police hope that mobile telephone calls made from Mannanthala and adjoining areas early on Friday will provide them clues about the identity of Renjith’s killers. The Crime Branch zeroed in on the culprits by identifying those who used their cell phones in the vicinity of the mobile phone towers near the murder spot at time of the crime. Assistant Commissioner K. Ramachandran and Circle Inspector K. E.

The event was held at the main entrance of UoH amid tight security. The campus walls sported stencil sketches of Vemula. Slogans were raised, demanding punishment to the ‘culprits’ behind his suicide. Though the university authorities had denied permission for the event and had asked heads of all departments to conduct classes, student protesters from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, Jawaharlal Nehru University, and Osmania University managed to get into the varsity in advance. The classes on Tuesday were, however, not disturbed. The meet witnessed the forceful opening of university gates by student protesters who were joined by Jaan Mohammed Saifi, brother of Akhlaq who was killed in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly consuming beef, and Radhika Vemula, mother of Rohith Vemula. Family of the student who went missing from JNU, Najeeb, and victims of caste atrocities in Una, Gujarat, Piyush Sarvaiya, Ramesh Sarvaiya and Jeetu Sarvaiya, also attended the event to offer solidarity.

Venugopal, Babu Prasad and K.K. Shaju and District Congress Committee president A.A. Shukoor. All three families were poor. He demanded that financial assistance of not less than Rs.2 lakh each be given to the families of the girls. Meanwhile, the State unit of the All India Mahila Samskarika Sangatana has demanded that the case be referred to the Central Bureau of Investigation. The police investigation had raised several doubts. The evidence was destroyed at the beginning itself. There were indications of the students being blackmailed. The journalist who had put out a report to that effect was manhandled. It all went to show that some forces were trying to prevent facts from coming out, it said. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-kerala\/Probe-unsatisfactory-says-Oommen-Chandy\/article15360489.ece"}

Manoj will be taken soon. Addressing members of the families of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and RSS workers who had lost their lives in attacks by alleged Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers in the region on Friday, Mr. Singh said a decision on the CBI investigation, recommended by the State government into the murder of Manoj, would be taken soon. The Minister said he had spoken to Chief Minister Oommen Chandy after the murder and demanded that action be taken to end violence in the region. The Chief Minister had promised all measures to ensure peace in the region, he said. The Home Minister said that violence had no place in a healthy democracy. Cultural and political movements in the State should launch a mass movement to isolate those parties that indulged in violence against their rivals. Stating that the Central government had taken political violence in the region seriously, he said that every party or organisation that favoured healthy politics should ensure that those practising violence in politics were defeated. He called for a public awareness campaign to isolate perpetrators of violence. Earlier, he visited the house of Manoj at Kathirur to meet the bereaved family. After the visit, he addressed the gathering of the families of slain BJP-RSS workers at the RSS office nearby. Large number of BJP-RSS workers turned up at the venue to attend the function held in the afternoon. The function was held amid tight police security in view of the tense situation in the area in the aftermath of the murder of Manoj.

The second and fourth semester exams of M.A., M.Sc. and M.com courses, which are crucial as they decide whether student will be promoted to second year or pass out of second year, have been scheduled from May 9. The first and third semester exams will be held from May 30. And the students seem to be in no mood to skip them citing the agitation as they have realised that they are crucial to complete the course. That the academic mood was back in place was reflected from the way the Ph.D. admission process was completed smoothly. “Our students are smart enough to understand that exams are crucial and they can't boycott them every time,” says B. Laxmaiah, OSD to Vice-Chancellor and who has dealt with students carefully at the peak of agitation as Dean of Students' Welfare. Repeatedly postponed In fact, the first and third semester examinations were scheduled on December 8, 2010. On the representation of the students they were postponed to December 18. But with the agitation in full swing and disturbances on the campus, they were further postponed. Meanwhile, the university went ahead with the commencement of class work for the next semester from December 22, 2010. These exams were subsequently scheduled from January 20 despite strong protests from students. Eventually, students of the campus and constituent colleges boycotted the exams while affiliated college students wrote the exams but in lesser numbers. The poor response could be gauged from the fact that out of 21,773 candidates only 3,391 appeared and the boycott was total in campus colleges. However, the university held exams for foreign students outside the campus ensuring that they didn't lose out. Senior teachers, concerned about the future of students, agreed that the university administration had made a smart move to conduct classes even as the exams were boycotted to ensure that the mandatory instruction days were met with. “This helped the university plan all the exams without losing much time,” agreed in-charge Vice-Chancellor D.N. Reddy. Meanwhile, students also made their intentions very clear recently when some of the JAC leaders declared that they would not be in a position to continue the agitation now as they had to concentrate on their upcoming exams. “In fact, a majority of the students were in favour of keeping the agitation and exams on different platforms. But the surcharged emotions after the release of Srikrishna Committee report made us to boycott exams,” a student leader agreed. Differences that cropped up between JAC leaders, who were mostly research scholars, and other students, who were mostly PG students, also reduced tension on the campus.

He was delivering human rights activist K. Balagopal Memorial Lecture here on Sunday. Mr. Khalid who called himself an anti-national, branded so by the media, said students’ movements posed the biggest threat to Hindutva forces and an attack on campuses after BJP ascended to power was expected. “When they went after Rohith Vemula they were not attacking a person. They were attacking a student leader and a fighter. They were also attacking Ambedkarite politics,” he said adding the BJP government tried to disrupt ‘justice for Rohith Vemula movement’ by cracking down on JNU students, including himself who supported Kashmir’s right to self determination. New solidarities Mr. Khalid said the slogan ‘Jai Bhim, Lal Salam’ that developed out of larger solidarities between students brings a ray of hope of meeting of two ideologies. The question of caste and the question of patriarchy are very important questions of times and these questions are internal to revolutionary transformation, Mr. Khalid, who holds a radical Left world-view, said. Challenging the government who ‘tried to rein-in students’, Mr. Khalid said: “They wanted to teach us a lesson. But we haven’t learnt that lesson. We will continue to uphold our political views.” Remembering Mr. Balagopal, who was a renowned lawyer, writer and activist, had helped contextualise political movements of his times, Mr. Khalid said “You could either agree or disagree with him but you could never have ignored him.” Human Rights Forum organised the meet to commemorate the seventh death anniversary of Mr. Balagopal. Struggle for rights Other speakers in the meet included member Communist Party of India’s National Council and president of Adivasi Mahasabha Manish Kunjam, faculty member in University of Hyderabad K. Y. Ratnam and Zameer Ahmed of Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society. Mr. Kunjam, who has been working in conflict-affected Bastar of Chhattisgarh, said the condition of Adivasis in Bastar is as bad as Kashmiris.

He alleged that the government was trying to keep the students in jail. “The elected representatives from Telangana have no moral right to take oath as Ministers in the new Cabinet that will be formed tomorrow as long as the students are languishing in jails. The posts they are ready to enjoy are because of the agitation by students,” he told a media conference at Sangareddy on Tuesday night. Stating that the Telangana agitation had spread to the nook and corner of the region because of the fast taken up by TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao last year, Mr. Kodandaram said that change of guard in the government would not help in stalling the ongoing agitation for separate State. “Many of the cases registered against students like Raja Ram, Errolla Srinivas and others are false. How can each student commit more than 60 to 70 crimes in a matter of eight to ten days? Moreover, all the cases are the same which even Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram gave assurance to withdraw,” he said. The demand made by students to amend 14 (F) clause and conduct the SI examinations was nothing new but one which was supported by all political parties.

Addressing an election rally here on Wednesday evening, Ms. Gandhi said the Congress which had never compromised with communal and terrorist forces had no lessons to take from the Left parties or the BJP in tackling terrorism and communalism. The nation witnessed a number of terrorist strikes and a dreaded terrorist was released to Afghanistan when BJP leader L.K. Advani was the Home Minister, she said. The opponents of the Congress, the CPI(M) and the BJP, had no issues to raise against the Congress and the UPA government and hence they were raising terrorism and communalism charges to attack Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, she said. Ms. Gandhi said the UPA government had given top priority to Kerala. It took steps to revive the plantation, cashew, coir, handloom and handicraft sectors. Projects worth Rs.40,000 crore were sanctioned to the State. The Left Democratic Front government was claiming the credit for the programmes implemented by the Centre. LDF government flayed She alleged that the LDF government’s administration was dismal, partisan and corrupt. Its policies did not reflect the aspirations of the youth. The law and order situation had worsened. Political interference had affected the functioning of the police, she said. Achievements Ms. Gandhi also listed out the achievements of the UPA government such as introducing 33 per cent reservation for women in local self-government institutions, implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, Right to Information Act, setting up of the Ministry for Overseas Indian Affairs and the Ministry for the Welfare of Minorities, setting up of a commission for the welfare of the economically weaker sections among the forward communities and implementation of the Sachar Commission report, agriculture loan waiver and various packages, among others.

The rally held on Monday, complete with circling helicopters and armoured vehicles, was at least the fourth such mass display in the region this year, intended as a show of force after a recent uptick in violence. Hundreds have died in Xinjiang in the past few years, mostly in unrest between the Muslim Uygur people, who call the region home, and the ethnic majority Han Chinese. Massive show of force staged in China’s Xinjiang region after terrorist attack Xinjiang’s Communist Party secretary Chen Quanguo told the ranks of armed police lined up outside Urumqi’s international convention centre that they must realise the “grim conditions” facing the region’s security. “Bury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the people’s war,” Chen said, according to the Xinjiang government’s official news site Tianshan Net on Tuesday. At an Urumqi airport later that day, Chen dispatched 1,500 armed police to the “frontlines” in the Xinjiang cities of Hotan, Kashgar and Aksu. Those cities, which have seen their own mass rallies in recent weeks, are part of the region’s southern Uygur heartland, where recent violence has flared. Three knife-wielding attackers killed five people and injured five others before being shot dead in Hotan this month. People’s Armed Police and military helicopters, as well as 10 civilian aircraft, carried the forces as part of an “all new” air-land mechanism that would bring high-speed armed helicopter patrols anywhere over Xinjiang’s vast and rugged territory, a notice posted to the Ministry of Defence’s website said. It did not give further details on the patrols. Armed police out in full force after deadly Xinjiang terror attack The People’s Armed Police is a specialist branch of paramilitary police akin to soldiers tasked with safeguarding domestic security and responding to riots, terrorist attacks and other emergencies. The air patrols have been rolled out along with a string of new measures in the ethnically divided region, including mandatory satellite tracking devices for vehicles in some areas, and increased rewards for anti-terror tips. State media that Xinjiang’s spending on public security jumped 19.3 per cent in 2016 to more than 30 billion yuan (US$4.37 billion). Rights groups and exiles say anger at tightening Chinese controls on the religion and culture of Uygurs is to blame for violence in the region, though China denies any repression.

His premature departure follows recent years of tension and clashes between the university’s governing body and students amid allegations of political interference in academic freedom at Hong Kong’s premier higher learning institute. In an email to colleagues, students and alumni, Mathieson said he was leaving for “personal reasons”, but stressed there would be “no loss of momentum at HKU” in the year ahead. Mathieson, who once described the vice-chancellorship of the city’s oldest university as the “best job” he had ever held, will leave his post by January next year – his contract with HKU is due to expire in 2019. The former dean of the University of Bristol’s medicine and dentistry faculty took the helm at HKU in April 2014, five months before the outbreak of the 79-day pro-democracy Occupy protests. A baptism by fire: HKU vice-chancellor Peter Mathieson’s term marked by political storms and mass protests His vice-chancellorship witnessed the HKU governing council’s controversial rejection of a liberal academic’s promotion to a senior manager’s job, and what he called “mob rule” by some students when they besieged a council meeting in January last year to press for a review of the university’s governance structure. “Perhaps most satisfyingly of all, repeatedly during the last three years we have articulated, promoted and defended the university’s core principles during a period of unprecedented political complexity in Hong Kong, ensuring that our students and staff can continue to flourish in an environment that respects their freedom of speech: long may this continue,” he wrote in his email. “There are very few universities in the world that could have tempted me to leave HKU but Edinburgh is one of them.” Mathieson, who earns an estimated HK$5.8 million a year, will take a huge pay cut after switching to the Scottish university, whose chief is offered an annual remuneration of £301,000. But he will be joining a globally more prestigious institution – Times Higher Education’s latest rankings put HKU at No 43, while Edinburgh University sits at 27. The Education Bureau said it respected what was a personal decision by Mathieson. “Appointment of presidents is a matter within the autonomy of the universities, for which the government has every respect,” a spokesman said. HKU council chairman Professor Arthur Li Kwok-cheung praised Mathieson for his leadership. “Peter has laid the foundation for the strategic development over the next 10 years of the university,” Li said, adding that the council would initiate a global search for a replacement as soon as possible. The academic at the centre of the promotion row, Johannes Chan Man-mun, expressed surprise at Mathieson’s resignation and warned that the appointment of his successor by the council was still a concern as it was wielding greater power. He told the Post: “It came as a surprise. A concern is the appointment of the next president. “It will be spearheaded by the council. At present the position of provost is still unfilled, and another vice-president (institutional development) tendered his resignation some months ago. “All these positions are to be appointed by the council, and the simultaneous availability of these vacancies will give the council great power to influence the senior management of HKU.” In at the deep end: HKU president remembers Occupy Council member Professor Timothy O’Leary said: “Concern is being expressed that [Mathieson’s] position became untenable due to disagreements with [Li].” He feared the appointment process “is likely to be contentious and politicised – which may, unfortunately, scare away many candidates for the job”. Chief executive contender Woo Kwok-hing said it was very unusual for university heads in Hong Kong to quit before their tenures expired and called for a clearer explanation. His three rivals for the city’s top job did not comment on Mathieson’s resignation. Cheung Sing-wai, chairman of HKU’s Academic Staff Association, said he believed Mathieson left due to “intense pressure” he was facing from the council. Student union president Althea Suen Hiu-nam said it was irresponsible for Mathieson to quit prematurely.

Hong Kong’s top pro-Beijing party suggests putting up own chief executive candidates 11 Mar 2016 Edward Leung Tin-kei may have lost the the Legislative Council by-election, but the 24-year-old has paved the way for a new era of Hong Kong politics where localist sentiments will increasingly come to matter. The pan-democrats scored a victory in New Territories East, with Civic Party’s Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu winning the seat and maintaining the bloc’s voting power in the chamber. But the emergence of candidates like Leung signals a looming battle for the city’s pro-democracy vote. Leung, who represented Hong Kong Indigenous, secured 66,524 of the 434,000 votes – a credible result of about 15.3%. An advocate of the once-marginalised idea of localism, and even independence, he beat veteran politician Nelson Wong Sing-chi and district councillor Christine Fong Kwok-shan to a place at the podium, behind Yeung and pro-establishment candidate Holden Chow Ho-ding, of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress for Hong Kong Yeung described Leung as an opponent he respected, and acknowledged that some of those who voted for him were not entirely satisfied with him, his party or the other pan-democrats. Watch: Localist candidate Edward Leung Tin-kei attempst to become Hong Kong’s youngest lawmaker “I promise I will advocate a reform within the pan-democratic camp to address [the concerns] raised in this era. From the votes gathered by Leung and me … it shows that [such reform] is imminent,” he said in his victory statement. Many people have labelled us as ‘thugs’, but the fact is even thugs received more than 50,000 votes. Edward Leung Prior to the official announcement of results on Monday morning, Leung said the outcome had already reflected how the localists had managed to “divide the territory” with the pan-democrat and pro-establishment camps. “Many people have labelled us as ‘thugs’, but the fact is even thugs received more than 50,000 votes,” he said. “This has proven that some people have agreed with our means to protest,” he added. Leung’s supporters outnumbered the followers of any other candidate at the by-election media centre on Monday morning, and chanted the slogan “Hong Kong independence” in unison as their candidate got on stage. The student said he had yet to decide whether to run again in the general election in September, but believed it would not be a surprise if the localist camp won any seats then. Chinese University political scientist Dr Ma Ngok said the number of votes Leung canvassed was greater than expected, but it was still too early to say whether the young student had a real chance to enter the Legco in the September elections. Now, with Hong Kong Indigenous getting more than 66,000 votes, it seems the Mong Kok incident, which [Chief Executive] Leung Chun-ying said was triggered only by the extreme minority, has won support from a considerable amount of people. Chinese University political scientist Dr Ma Ngok “There are no other alternatives representing the radicals or localists in this by-election, but there will definitely be more than one choice in the general elections,” he said, referring to incumbent radical lawmakers Raymond Chan Chi-chuen and “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung, as well as the the post-Occupy group Youngspiration, which is likely to field candidates in the polls. Leung had gained support not only from those who supported the idea of localism or even independence, but also those who were dissatisfied with the performance of traditional pan-democrats and who sympathised with what happened in Mong Kok. “Now, with Hong Kong Indigenous getting more than 66,000 votes, it seems the Mong Kok incident, which [Chief Executive] Leung Chun-ying said was triggered only by the extreme minority, has won support from a considerable amount of people,” said Ma, the head of the school’s government and public administration department. “The government should reflect on why the violent protests could still win support from many,” he aded. Ma believed many Hongkongers wanted to make a statement on the Mong Kok disturbances earlier this month via their ballot papers, which helped Leung’s campaign. But he said it was uncertain whether Leung could keep the momentum as “a lot of things could happen before September”. READ MORE: Vox pop – pros and cons of radical politics and filibustering by legislators dominate Hong Kong by-election debate Despite the highly charged political atmosphere following the riot and the contentious ongoing filibustering in Legco, the DAB’s Chow still failed to take advantage of key rival Yeung being sandwiched between radical and moderate voters. Chow secured almost 35 per cent of the 434,000 votes cast, compared to Yeung’s 37 per cent. One of the reasons is probably because New Territories East, with its considerable number of middle-class and professional voters, has always been the stronghold of the pan-democrats. In 2012, the voters of this constituency sent six pan-democrats to the legislature out of the nine seats, the highest proportion in all five geographical constituencies. Ma said Chow was also not a candidate who could win the hearts of liberal pro-establishment supporters. “Those who voted for James Tien [of the Liberal Party] were unlikely to vote for Chow this time,” he said. In 2012, the eight pan-democratic candidates secured 55.7 per cent of the total votes, 3.4 percentage points more than what Yeung and Leung canvassed in total this time round. On the other hand, the pro-establishment camp secured 42.9 per cent of the votes four years ago, with some 12 per cent going to the Liberal Party and to Fong. Ma believed some pro-democracy supporters might have switched to support the so-called moderate candidate, but added it was normal for them to “lose some votes” in a by-election like this. “There are only two pro-democracy candidates in the race this time, but there were eight in 2012. It is unlikely for the duo to cover all voters across the spectrum,” he said, adding that the same applied on Chow. READ MORE: Why Hong Kong by-election today matters: rifts in two main blocs could make localists the big winners even if their man loses The results, meanwhile, also highlighted the tough road ahead for the so-called “middle-of-the-road” approach in the highly polarised city. Former lawmaker Wong, who was expelled from the Democratic Party last year and now leads the new group Third Side, secured a mere 17,295 votes, way below than the 21,118 votes he got in 2012. Fong, considered a liberal pro-establishment candidate, scored 33,424 votes, 8,830 more than she did four years ago. The pair had together garnered not more than 12 per cent of the total ballots. Ma said the vote share was more or less the same compared to the previous election. “There would only be less room for such moderate approach in a polarised city … it is not an easy task for these moderates to gain support from the so-called moderate voters in September,” he said. Activist Oscar Lai Man-lok, who will soon form a new party with convenor of student-led group Scholarism Joshua Wong Chi-fung to contest the September polls, said the election results had shown that Hongkongers are looking for real reform. Lai believed the so-called post-Occupy or localist groups would likely field candidates in New Territories East in the coming citywide polls as it had the largest number of progressive pro-democracy voters. “The one who needs to worry the most is Gary Fan Kwok-wai,” he said. The Neo Democrat, an incumbent lawmaker who advocated the idea of “Hongkongers first”, was the last one to secure a seat in New Territories East in 2012, with 28,621 votes. Ma also said there was not much room for the pan-democrats and localists to coordinate in the upcoming elections, meaning the former would face a tough challenge in the next polls as more candidates were expected to compete for the pro-democracy votes.

While Tahrir Square was the frenzied center of their uprising, the Egyptians made no mistake from day one in their consistent calling for the unconditional resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. The goal was both precise and persistent. PUBLISHED : Wednesday, 16 February, 2011, 6:41pm 19 Oct 2016 If the Egyptians could do it, why can’t the Chinese? While Tahrir Square was the frenzied center of their uprising, the Egyptians made no mistake from day one in their consistent calling for the unconditional resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. The goal was both precise and persistent. In Tiananmen Square, the slogans of Chinese students in 1989 were limited to milder and more vague moral demands, such as “anti-corruption. ” Nobody dared to utter the blasphemy of “down with Deng Xiaoping,” although he was rumored to have an emergency airplane ready for an exit. The Chinese simply think that the emperor is a good guy, but has merely made some “mistakes.” When three protestors from Hunan threw eggs at the portrait of Chairman Mao, they were treated as criminals, seized by students and handed over to the public security bureau officers immediately. The three got long prison sentences of up to 18 years thanks to the vigilance of the students-cum-Red-Guards. With an “uprising” of this kind, Beijing had little to worry about. The Egyptians were willing to pay a price for their change—a few dozen protesters died in violent scuffles with President Mubarak’s police. The Chinese are obsessed with the “principle” of Gandhi-style non-violence, while forgetting they are no Indians and their rival is not as benevolently vegetarian as the British. Were there any informers infiltrated into the gatherings at Tahrir Square? Perhaps, but at that moment the Egyptians would never allow Mubarak’s regime to employ a divide-and-rule tactic. They united and took part passionately in the uprising rather than stepping aside and waiting to lay their bet on the winner’s side. In the jungle called China, there is simply a greater variety of political animals. For example, a species of flunkies and eunuchs are ready and willing to help consolidate the power of a master who’s being challenged by offering to turn informers or propagandists for the regime. If an uprising succeeds, flunkies and eunuchs tend to keep their jobs because the winner turns into a new emperor very soon, and will need the same service. It sounds a bit like the role of civil servants in normal countries like Britain, the US and Japan, but it’s not quite the same. The Chinese equivalent is a more psychologically sophisticated, but vicious one. And finally, do the Chinese really want freedom that much or are they fearful of being free, as the Frankfurt-born psychologist Enrich Fromm once famously put it? True, an authoritarian structure removes choices and freedom, but for an unimaginative and mentally lazy people, it also removes anxiety. The Chinese love to conform to group norms without bothering to understand what those norms mean—take the recent frenzies for golf or French red wines, for example. Preferring to survive under an emperor is another timeless norm that Western liberals find hard to comprehend. So the Swiss bankers may be busy in the coming weeks freezing and handing over Mubarak’s assets, but some others will remain untouched for a very long time You may also like url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/magazines\/hk-magazine\/article\/2033201\/why-tahrir-no-tiananmen"}

They are cowards who dare not face down rural leaders, many of whom look more like triad bosses. Low-income families must wait years for public housing. Many live in squalid subdivided flats the size of jail cells. Middle-income families must pay HK$3 million for 200 sq ft flats. Property prices are so high that ordinary Hongkongers cannot afford homes. Yet our gutless government saves large chunks of scarce land for so-called indigenous villagers. There is nothing indigenous about them. They either sell their free land or build houses for sale or rent. It's time to prove Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying has spine. A matter of trust and wanting the same thing Beijing does not trust Hong Kong voters with what pan-democrats call a genuine choice of candidates for the 2017 chief executive election. The pan-democrats say this mistrust is misguided because Hongkongers are politically savvy enough not to elect an unpatriotic chief executive. Civic Party chairwoman Audrey Eu Yuet-mee repeated that mantra on radio last week. So let's understand this: Beijing wants a chief executive it can trust. The pan-democrats say no problem, voters will do just that. Sounds like both sides want the same thing. So why do the pan-democratic lawmakers want to veto a reform framework that screens out unpatriotic candidates when they say voters will not elect such candidates anyway? Puzzling, unless a genuine choice of candidates really means the choice to elect someone Beijing does not trust. Public more tolerant of pan-dems behaving badly Food and Health Secretary Dr Ko Wing-man must be scratching his head. Many will remember his astonishing outburst when confronted by a man who berated him for urging Hongkongers to accept Beijing's political reforms. Public Eye thought television images of the mild-mannered Ko standing up to a protester would earn public applause. Wrong. Ko, the most popular government minister, saw his public opinion rating plunge. Another poll showed officials' district visits to sway opinion for the reforms had backfired and support had dropped. Pan-democrats must be scratching their heads, too. They have disrupted officials' events so often it makes Ko look like an angel. Last week, legislator \"Long Hair\" Leung Kwok-hung and others wrecked a school debating contest to heckle Chief Secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and other officials. They did not care about robbing the pupils of their moment in the spotlight. Which should turn people off more - a government official losing his cool at someone who scolded him or protesters ruining a school debate? But will the next poll show a plunge in Long Hair's rating or in support for the pan-democrats? No way. When officials hit back at critics, their ratings dive. When radical pan-democrats hurl bananas and swear at officials, nothing happens. Is there a moral to this?

The number of ATKTs permitted to a student was changed by this rule. \"As a result of this, we couldn't concentrate on any one exam, as we had to appear for so many,'' said a student. Besides, students stated they were not informed about the fact that they did not have to compulsorily appear for the exams.\n\nSeveral students went to court, demanding that the rules be waived for this year. At least one student got a favourable judgement, while others didn't. Since there is still no uniform rule on whether the students -- belonging to various semesters -- should be allowed to appear for the examinations, the students have been demanding that the university come out with a common rule.\n\nWednesday's demonstration was the second one organised with the help of the Bharatiya Vidyarti Sena (BVS). One was held earlier this month. Following this, the university has decided to hold a meeting of principals of all engineering colleges on January 16. Their decision will be conveyed to the students on January 19, according to Pro Vice-Chancellor Dr Naresh Chandra.\n\nStudents -- around 1,000 of who are said to be affected -- claimed that college authorities allowed them to attend classes, and work on their project, despite their having failed to clear their exams. However, they were later told that they could not get term grant. \"This means that our work will go waste. We are not asking to be allowed to appear for the exam. We will clear our backlog and only then appear for the exam,'' one student said.\n\nHowever, the university officials contend that at least four colleges did not allow the students who failed to attend lectures and to work on their project. The final decision will be taken after considering the problems of these students too. url : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/Storyold\/73413\/"}

Hong Kong police accused of political correctness in revising official account of 1967 riots Force criticised for taking out sensitive references such as 'red fat cats' and 'communist militia' in describing riots, but claims changes were supposed to make account 'more concise' PUBLISHED : Tuesday, 15 September, 2015, 12:00am The police force has amended its official version of history during the 1967 riots by replacing phrases like \"communist militia\" with \"gunmen\" and deleting detailed descriptions of the events, such as pro-Beijing leftist mobs threatening bus and tram drivers who refused to strike. A former senior policeman involved in the suppression of the riots called such change \"unnecessary\", while a political scientist said it showed how political correctness was foremost in the minds of officials. However a police spokesman said the amendments were motivated only be a wish to offer a \"more concise presentation of content with revised wordings\". READ MORE: Leftists' role in riots must not be whitewashed By contrasting the current and a previous version of the webpage archived in June last year, which offers an official perspective of how the force views its own history between 1945 and 1967, web users of HKGolden - an online forum popular among youngsters critical of the establishment - found that certain parts had vanished. Revisions were made to both the Chinese and English-language accounts . The 1967 riots were an extension of the mainland's Cultural Revolution, during which pro-Beijing radicals turned to violence in seeking to overthrow the colonial government. A paragraph that details the height of the riots after the trigger point of an increase in Star Ferry fares was cut by more than half. Among passages deleted were references to rioters waving the Quotations of Chairman Mao when they marched on Government House. References to attacks on members of the public and the behaviour of local \"red elites\" were also taken out. The description of culprits who killed five policemen and injured nine others in what is described as the \"most serious incident of that year of violence\" have been changed from \"communist militia\" to \"gunmen\". Below is the single largest chunk of text removed: \"Bus and tram drivers were threatened, sometimes attacked if they went to work to keep Hong Kong on the move. Bombs were made in classrooms of left-wing schools and planted indiscriminately on the streets. Struggle committees were formed to foment strife against the government, although it was swiftly apparent none of the leaders [went] to China to participate in the nationwide strife that was taking such an appalling toll, and the wealthy businessmen who had blessed the troubles, the 'red fat cats', dispatched their children to universities in the much-disparaged United States and Britain.\" A former senior superintendent involved in the suppression of the riots, James Elms, said he felt disappointed by the \"unnecessary\" changes. By withholding certain facts such as referring to communist militia as merely gunmen, Elms said the attempt to downplay the role of politics in a politically charged event had changed the nature of facts. \"This can only produce the opposite effect if the intention is to minimise the controversy and discussion,\" he said.

Vendors slaughtered dogs and cooked their meat in dozens of restaurants across the city of Yulin, at an event that has come to symbolise the cruelty and potential for spreading disease associated with the largely unregulated industry. We came to Yulin to tell people here dogs are our friends. They should not kill dogs in such a cruel way and many of the dogs they killed are pet dogs Yang Yuhua, animal rights volunteer Activists bought dogs from dealers who had been planning to slaughter them, while local residents complained that outsiders were ruining what they consider a local tradition. “We came to Yulin to tell people here dogs are our friends,” said Yang Yuhua, a volunteer from the central city of Chongqing. “They should not kill dogs in such a cruel way and many of the dogs they killed are pet dogs.” An estimated 10 million to 20 million dogs are killed for their meat each year in China, and the Yulin event has become a lightning rod for criticism. International protests against dog eating festival in China have backfired, say locals Many of the dogs are believed to have been pets stolen from their owners or simply picked up off the street. The so-called dog-meat eating festival has never been officially recognised by government or by any regulations or laws Yulin city government official They are stuffed in cages, and trucked to the city about 2,000km south of Beijing in the province of Guangxi, often without food or water. Cats eaten at the festival are subjected to similar ill treatment. The local government has in recent years sought to disassociate itself from the event, forbidding its employees from attending and limiting its size by shutting down some dog markets and slaughter houses. “The so-called dog-meat eating festival has never been officially recognised by government or by any regulations or laws,” said an official reached by telephone at the city government’s general office. Yulin pledges to ban slaughter of dogs in public as controversial food festival draws near “We hold meetings every time before the so-called festival, discussing counter measures such as deploying local police, business and sanitary authorities to inspect and deal with those who sell dogs,” said the official, who like many Chinese bureaucrats would give only his surname, Liu, because he was not authorised to speak to reporters. Opponents this year expanded their campaign to the United States, petitioning politicians in San Francisco to pressure their Chinese colleagues into calling for an end to the slaughter. It’s been a tradition for years for us to celebrate the festival. We can’t change it simply because [animal lovers] love dogs Yulin resident As many as 10,000 dogs are believed to be killed during the event, which falls around the summer solstice that arrived on Monday this year. Promoters say eating dog meat during the summer helps ward off the heat and maintain a healthy metabolism. “It’s been a tradition for years for us to celebrate the festival. We can’t change it simply because they [animal lovers] love dogs,” a local resident said. “They don’t want us to eat dog meat. We eat dog meat to celebrate the festival, but since they’ve come here, they’ve ruined our mood completely.” Opponents say the festival is cruel and has no redeeming cultural value. Another animal rights activist, Chen Chun, said the push to end the Yulin festival was part of a larger campaign to pass legislation banning animal cruelty. A draft animal cruelty law remains mired in China’s legislature and prosecution of dog thieves and those violating animal transport laws remains lax, activists complain. “Our ultimate goal is that the country can make a law to protect animals, especially dogs here,” Chen said. Activists debated and argued with local residents, with police intervening at times to prevent any physical confrontations. Activists said rallies held around the country to oppose dog eating, as well as outrage on social media from the growing ranks of dog lovers, are already having an effect. Dog meat restaurants have been forced to take the festival indoors and large-scale open air dog-meat consumption is no longer seen. Along with the question of animal cruelty, dog meat also posed a risk to human health by spreading diseases such as trichinellosis, rabies and cholera, the Humane Society said.

In a 75-page election manifesto released on Monday morning, the former finance chief dropped a bombshell with his tax review proposals, saying his team would look into the possibility of introducing a progressive profit tax to lighten the burden on small and medium enterprises, and investigate the feasibility of a negative income tax to offer an allowance to people whose incomes fell below a certain level. Tsang also pledged to improve the government’s accountability and placed specific emphasis on youth development and education, in a bid to win the hearts and minds of liberal and moderate pan-democrats. For the sake of our society’s stability and good governance, we must therefore, with the greatest determination and courage, restart the process to amend the procedure to elect the chief executive during the next term of the government. John Tsang, chief executive hopeful The former financial secretary, who had earlier said it would be irresponsible for the administration to restart political reform if the political climate remained unchanged, made a U-turn by promising to relaunch the process “with the greatest determination and courage” should he be elected. There would be continual challenges to the government’s legitimacy without the realisation of universal suffrage, Tsang argued. “For the sake of our society’s stability and good governance, we must therefore, with the greatest determination and courage, restart the process to amend the procedure to elect the chief executive during the next term of the government,” he wrote. “I do not underestimate the difficulties of achieving consensus on political reform. But I believe if we can formulate a chief executive election plan which is acceptable to different quarters, that will be a big step forward for Hong Kong’s political system, and both Hong Kong people and ‘one country, two systems’ will be winners.” He vowed to communicate closely with different groups and facilitate dialogue between these groups and Beijing in order to improve understanding and build consensus. John Tsang raises HK$3m for election fund through crowdfunding, Carrie Lam says work to do on social media Despite his liberal stance on reform, Tsang raised eyebrows with his position on the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, which requires the enaction of a local law to protect national security. The administration was forced to shelve such a bill in 2003 after half a million people, who feared that their freedoms and rights would be curbed, took to the streets. “The Basic Law has now been implemented in Hong Kong for close to 20 years. There is no reason for the HKSAR government to delay the enactment of local legislation in accordance with Article 23 any longer,” Tsang said. “I believe the main concern is not about whether to legislate or not, but about the details of the law and the legislative procedures.” He proposed to conduct a thorough public consultation on the legislation of Article 23, including publishing a proposed law in the form of a “white bill” to solicit public views on the contents. Tsang, who is in a close race with former chief secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, also promised to improve the government’s integrity and transparency by extending the application of Sections 3 and 8 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance to the chief executive and to establish an independent committee to give permission for the acceptance of advantages by the city’s leader. Incumbent top official Leung Chun-ying has been reluctant to implement the above recommendations by the Independent Review Committee for the Prevention and Handling of Potential Conflicts of Interest, chaired by former chief justice Andrew Li Kwok-nang. To address discontent among the city’s young people, Tsang vowed to foster their participation in policy discussion by building a new youth platform and setting a ratio for the appointment of new blood to certain government advisory boards and committees. He suggested abolishing all Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA) and Basic Competence Assessment (BCA) tests in primary and secondary schools to halt the practice of intensive drilling. Chinese history should be made an independent compulsory subject in junior secondary school, he added. On planning and housing, Tsang said he would implement the East Lantau Metropolis plan without compromising country parks and ecologically sensitive marine areas and increase public housing with a goal to accommodate 60 per cent of the total population in government-subsidised flats. In response to a fast-greying population, Tsang adopted a suggestion earlier floated by the Elderly Service Programme Plan to reinstate population-based planning ratios for elderly services in the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines. Carrie Lam promises ‘new style’ of Hong Kong leadership, with housing her priority At a rally attended by many of Hong Kong’s business and political elite on Friday, Tsang’s key rival Lam outlined the key points of her election platform, which included introducing “new styles” of governance. Lam said she hoped to reveal more on her platform, which was still being drafted, on the coming Sunday. Tsang is due to meet the press at 2.30pm on Monday to introduce his full platform. Key points of Tsang’s platform Economic development • Promote renminbi as currency for reserve and settlement • Develop high-end logistics industry • Make Hong Kong Asia’s fintech hub • Encourage commercialisation of research outcomes • Open more government data and improve government’s electronic data platform Tax review • Examine feasibility of introducing progressive profit tax and “negative income tax” Planning and housing • Develop New Territories North and retain unique features of small towns • Better use of brownfield and deserted agricultural land through integrated planning • Speed up redevelopment of aged public housing • Address small house issues in New Territories flexibly and examine feasibility of building muiti-storey blocks or estates with mixed small houses and home-ownership flats Transport • Encourage use of electric cars and buses • Implement Electronic Road Pricing pilot scheme in Central Environmental protection • Protect water quality in rural areas • Take action against dumping into rivers and ocean, enhance communication with Guangdong authorities Youth development and education • Enable young people’s participation in policy discussion • Abolish all TSA and BCA tests • Introduce Chinese history and Hong Kong history in junior secondary curriculum • Consult and review whether chief executive should be chancellor of universities Culture and sports • Create new Cultural and Sports Bureau • Launch 10-year plan for sports Medical and labour • Promote family medicine and primary care • Full consultation on MPF offsetting issue Assistance for underprivileged and elderly • Review lump sum grant for subvented welfare organisations • Offer more resource support for ethnic minorities to study Chinese and for admission to kindergarten • Introduce town-planning standards to cover elderly homes Hong Kong News url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/politics\/article\/2068412\/john-tsang-unveils-election-platform-covering-issues"}

Pu Zhiqiang was being held at the Beijing No 1 Detention Centre and was in good health, according to one of the lawyers, Qu Zhenhong. Also visiting Pu was Zhang Sizhi, who is in his late 80s and is one of the country's most eminent lawyers. Zhang was part of the defence team during the trial of the \"counter-revolutionary\" Gang of Four in 1980 following the Cultural Revolution. Pu, who took part in the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests in 1989, was detained for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\", a charge frequently used against activists. At least four people were placed in criminal detention after they attended a low-key event at a house in Beijing on Saturday ahead of the 25th anniversary of the crackdown. The charge, which has in the past been widely criticised as a common measure to tackle dissidents, can result in a prison term of up to 10 years. \"The meeting went smoothly and Pu appeared to be well,\" Qu said. Authorities have been watching Pu for some time ... and now comes the attack Unnamed source A person familiar with the case said the authorities had carried out checks on Pu's law firm last year, but failed to find any irregularities. \"The authorities have been watching Pu and other activist lawyers for some time, and now comes the attack,\" the source said. The Global Times, a state-run newspaper known for its hawkish stance, said in an editorial that the event to commemorate the June 4 crackdown had \"clearly crossed the red line of the law\" as it was related to \"the most sensitive political issue\" in China. \"These activist lawyers, who have wild intentions to challenge and change the law, have deviated from the scope of their own job. They are more like social activists rather than legal practitioners,\" it said. \"They must regain self-awareness and realise they are not commandos or authoritative forces to improve China's rule of law.\" Pu's detention aroused huge public sympathy because of his reputation for protecting civil rights and in cases involving in the re-education through labour system. He has been openly critical of ex-security tsar Zhou Yongkang, who is believed to be the subject of a graft investigation.

The invalidation of Yeung Ke-cheong’s candidacy in Kowloon West came just one day after Chan Ho-tin, convenor of the Hong Kong National Party, was banned from the race by the Electoral Affairs Commission for “violating Basic Law ”, the city’s mini-constitution since its handover in 1997. Yeung, of the Democratic Progressive Party of Hong Kong, was positioned second on a candidate list with Jonathan Ho Chi-kwong in Kowloon West. Ho’s nomination was validated, but Yeung’s was not. Legco ‘super seat’ candidates discuss push for Hong Kong independence, chief executive race at election forum “I was disqualified as I deliberately stated that I would not uphold the Basic Law and thus did not sign the relevant statement,” Yeung wrote on his Facebook page on Sunday. Both Ho and Yeung did not sign the additional declaration form introduced by Electoral Affairs Commission weeks ago which reinforces acknowledgement that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China, while the latter even refused to sign the standard nomination form required by the Legislative Council Ordinance. Section 40(1)(b) of the ordinance states that a person’s candidacy will not be validated unless his nomination form includes a declaration that he will uphold the Basic Law and pledges allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Instead, Yeung submitted to the watchdog a separate statement asserting that the city’s mini-constitution no longer applied to the situation in Hong Kong today and thus it would be difficult for him to sincerely uphold it. “I fully understand such a move does not comply with the requirement ...and could ban me from running,” Yeung wrote in the statement. “But I think the relevant legal clauses have violated basic human rights and freedom of speech ...On this basis I will launch a judicial review.” Meanwhile, Chan, who was disqualified on Saturday even he had signed the required form , vowed on Sunday to stage a series of actions to “subvert” the polls. “I have already signed the form but [the returning officer] suggested my pledge is not sincere enough. Apparently the decision has nothing to do with law but political views,” Chan told RTHK’s City Forum on Sunday. Chan said the precedent was dangerous as the ban could be extended in future to candidates who opposed the Communist Party or the chief executive. More young Hongkongers back independence and are less supportive of peaceful protest, poll shows “We will soon launch a series of actions to subvert the elections which will largely undermine the legitimacy of the polls,” Chan warned as he vowed to challenge the decision in court via a judicial review or election petition. Crossing swords with Chan in the forum, Beijing loyalist Wong Kwan-yu, a member of the Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee, said the “reasonable” decision by the returning officer had sent a very strong message to the city: “Separatists would be banned from the political arena.” Brave Chan Yung, a National People’s Congress delegate, went further by comparing Chan and his allies with terrorism, claiming countries including Britain and Canada would exhaust every means to combat terrorist activities and separatism. I do not think the returning officer has any power to screen candidates on the basis of their political opinion Legal scholar Benny Tai Yiu-ting University of Hong Kong legal scholar Benny Tai Yiu-ting, who founded the Occupy movement in 2014, said there was no clause in the Basic Law that allowed the government to ban separatist hopefuls from elections – unless the mini-constitution was amended. “I do not think the returning officer has any power to screen candidates on the basis of their political opinion,” he said. “There will be a very high chance the court may strike down the decision of the returning officer in the election petition [filed by Chan].” Tai said the ban was a huge blow to the legitimacy of the elections. “We can see from the recent survey that there might be 17 per cent of the population who support or show sympathy to independence. If you do not allow any candidate advocating that kind of view to participate in the election, [it] surely will not be able to fully reflect the different views of Hong Kong people.” Hong Kong News url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/politics\/article\/1997341\/banned-hong-kong-independence-candidate-vows-subvert"}
{"url":"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/lifestyle\/health\/article\/1213129\/hku-medical-students-street-crusade","text":"HKU medical students in street crusade Medical students launch creative street campaigns to boost public awareness PUBLISHED : Monday, 15 April, 2013, 12:00am It’s dog eat dog as China declares war on man’s best friend 29 Jul 2017 Aspiring doctors from the University of Hong Kong's (HKU) faculty of medicine have put a street-smart spin on health awareness campaigns to reach the average, busy Hongkonger. Their creative initiatives include roadside dramas about bone-marrow donation and on-the-spot demos for pedestrians on how to treat a victim of a heart attack, to campaigns on the importance of colorectal cancer screenings. This is to teach students that, as future doctors, they should also be public health advocates, says Dennis Ip Kai-ming, clinical assistant professor with HKU's Department of Community Medicine. The project, which began in 1999, is part of the school's Problem-based Public Health module, which is compulsory for all Year Three students. Ip says the programme is unique. \"As far as we are aware, this is the only health advocacy programme taught in a comprehensive and systematic manner in any undergraduate medical curriculum in the whole world,\" he says. The two-month course consists of seminars, tutorials about public health issues in Hong Kong and the world, and advocacy campaigns. The module touches on common public health problems like air pollution, smoking, drug abuse, stroke prevention and the harmful effects of eating fast food. Students have a responsibility and the ability to champion changes to address public health problems Dennis Ip, HKU professor Students are taught how to identify gaps in the public health system and how to formulate their key messages to the target audience in a simple and easily understandable way. \"We want them to realise … they have a responsibility and the ability to champion changes to address public health problems,\" says Ip. Crystal Cheung Wing-lam and her group, for instance, found that bone marrow donors were severely lacking in the city, with only 1.3 per cent of of the city's seven million population registered as donors. \"The registry was set up around 20 years ago, but so far only 664 transplants involving bone marrow have been conducted,\" Cheung says. \"A patient has only a one in 5,000 to 10,000 chance to get a matched sample from people to whom he has no blood relation,\" she says. \"Every year, there are 1,000 new cases of blood-related diseases like leukaemia and severe thalassemia [a recessive blood disorder] that require bone marrow transplants. \"I want to let the public know that you might be the only one out there who can save the patient,\" she says. So Cheung came up with the idea of a drama performance to promote donation, refuting common misconceptions about being a donor. \"Many people think that it's a complicated process to be registered as a donor. They think that once they are registered, they will be subject to an invasive extraction procedure. But actually, all you need to do is sign up at the blood donation centre when you give blood.\" The street campaigns are not just eye-opening for the public, but also for the students. While researching for their project, Benjamin So Yu-fai and nine classmates found there was a dearth of cardiac-resuscitation devices - called automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) - in public areas around the city. The device, if used within the first 10 minutes of a heart attack, can save the victim's life. \"Hong Kong lags far behind other nations like Taiwan and the US in the installation of the devices in public areas,\" So says. \"There are not many places in Hong Kong that are equipped with the devices. They have such devices in MTR stations but they are not displayed conspicuously. If someone sees a person keel over on the platform and goes to ask for the device from MTR staff, by the time they get it, it will be too late to resuscitate them.\" To raise awareness about the problem, So's group spent time in the streets of Mong Kok and Causeway Bay in February to speak to passers-by about the importance of AEDs. From his interactions with the people, So says they identified another crucial problem: \"They don't know how to use the device. The government should boost education of the public.\" The HKU students have been gathering signatures for a petition asking the government to install such devices in public places and teach people how to use them. Associate professor Janice Johnston, of the community medicine department, says the project gives students a chance to be more involved with the community and become aware of the inequalities in the public health system. \"The project can help them gain experience of advocating for community,\" she says. \"This project can give them much broader perspective about health within the community.\" This was certainly the case for Matthew Law Chun-wah, whose project on colorectal cancer required him to liaise with professionals and organisations such as the Anti-Cancer Society and Cancer Fund. \"Bowel cancer is the second cancer killer in the city, with 4,000 new cases per year,\" says Law, whose group braved the Causeway Bay crowds to promote colorectal screening. \"People aged over 50 should get a colonoscopy once every 10 years. The colon polyps, which can be identified and removed, will evolve into cancer if they are left untreated.\" Have the HKU programme's lessons resonated with students? For Cheung, they have. \"Being a doctor involves a lot more than just curing patients. It's also our responsibility to draw public attention to public health issues that people might overlook in their busy lives.\" STYLE url : http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/lifestyle\/health\/article\/1213129\/hku-medical-students-street-crusade"}

Andy Tsang Wai-hung said officers did not know until she was arrested on Wednesday that Melody Chan Yuk-fung had joined the movement to occupy roads in the city centre in a pro-democracy protest planned for next year. \"The speculation that [this arrest] is related to Occupy Central is purely speculation. There is no basis in it at all,\" Tsang said. The speculation that [this arrest] is related to Occupy Central is purely speculation. There is no basis in it at all His remark was rejected by Chan, a trainee solicitor. The police commissioner said an arrest warrant had been issued for Chan in January last year over her part in a July 1, 2011, demonstration. He said officers had contacted her to say she would be arrested and charged, but she declined to go to the police station. Officers made more than 20 calls and visited her home 10 times without success, but they did not go to her workplace or put her on a border stop list as they wanted to keep the operation \"low profile\", Tsang said. On her Facebook page, Chan said she covered Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying's official visit to Beijing in April last year and also travelled to Sweden in August. She said she encountered no problems leaving and entering Hong Kong on both trips. \"I even took the same plane as Leung Chun-ying when I returned,\" she wrote. \"Does Andy Tsang mean that a wanted person can walk freely under the eyes of customs and police, even beside the chief executive?\" Responding to Tsang's \"low profile\" assertion, Chan wrote: \"So they deployed officers to ambush me downstairs from my office, and took action only after I left The Landmark and walked to the public space outside World-Wide House?\" Some 231 people were detained in Central in 2011 at a sit-in after the annual July 1 rally. After attending a Kwai Tsing District Council meeting yesterday, Tsang said all the people that the Department of Justice had instructed the police to arrest had now been arrested. Before the meeting, he told dozens of pan-democrat demonstrators not to subscribe to a conspiracy theory on police handling of protesters. During the meeting, he faced tough questions from councillors on Chan's arrest and protest arrangements. Chan, who is charged with assisting in the holding of an unauthorised assembly and taking part in an unauthorised assembly, is due in Eastern Court today. The 30SGroup, an association of young professionals of which Chan is a member, condemned the government and police for making a political arrest. The chief executive yesterday said he was confident about the professionalism and capability of the police, but declined to comment on Chan's arrest because Tsang was expected to explain the matter. Leung said it was difficult to predict what would happen if the Occupy Central demonstration went ahead in July next year, because it was an unprecedented movement \"completely different\" from previous post-rally road blockades.

Every year, after the last working day on April 30, I rejoin from mid-June. This year, I was told to join from August when the new batch begins.

The recruits, at Valluvar Kottam shouted slogans including, “HCL lend us your ears, give us back our two years,” while undertaking the day-long fast. “We met HCL officials twice at their Haddows Road office, but every time we did, they asked us to wait until August. How long are we supposed to wait hoping they will call us someday?” asked another recruit. “Also, the ‘letter of intent’ the company gave us is valid only till this June.

In the charged atmosphere generated by the dangerous currents of domestic politics and media-induced panic, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is finding himself under tremendous pressure to respond decisively to initial evidence that ‘elements in Pakistan’ were responsible for last week’s terrorist outrage in Mumbai. What the government has said and done so far has been measured and correct. It has been mindful of the responsibility and restraint with which the world expects India to conduct itself. And it has reflected the reality that Pakistan today is a country and polity and society that is more at war with itself than with any other adversary, real or imagined. And yet, with elections around the corner and the ruling Congress party under attack for its inept management of internal security, the danger of politically-induced overreach always remains. External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee got off to a sober and dignified start last week when he told his Pakistani counterpart that the elements responsible for the carnage did not want a “leap forward” in relations between India and Pakistan and were hence acting against Islamabad’s interests as well. And on Monday, India issued a demarche to Pakistan in which it said it expected “strong action” against those responsible for the attacks, “whosoever they may be.” But with TV channels declaring “enough is enough” and calling for the start of a “real war” on terror, the government finds itself increasingly on the back foot. Over the weekend, there was wild speculation about a punitive troop build-up by India along the Pakistan border, the suspension of the dialogue process, the snapping of air and bus links and even, most improbably, the termination by India of the ceasefire along the Line of Control that has saved hundreds of soldiers’ lives on this side since it was first put in place more than five years ago. Placed alongside this rich menu of macho “options,” Monday’s demarche has been attacked by critics as too timid. And predictably, the Opposition has gone for the jugular with at least one senior BJP leader irresponsibly demanding action by India similar to what the United States did after 9\/11 — that is, war. Too early It is too early to say how these demands for an immediate and decisive response to what happened in Mumbai will affect relations with Pakistan. One would have thought the futility of offensive troop deployments and the suspension or downgrading of normal transport and diplomatic relations — methods the BJP-led Vajpayee government unsuccessfully tried after the terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001 — would be apparent by now. And despite the new ‘cold start’ doctrine of the Indian Army, all proponents of ‘limited war’ and ‘surgical strikes’ on terrorist camps are silent on how an eventual conventional escalation can be avoided. “We don’t have too many options but it is not as if we have zero options either,” a senior Indian official told The Hindu. A firm message delivered quietly is often more effective than loud declarations or threats. “But as the political and media pressure mounts, it becomes harder for us to exercise those options.” The executioners of the terrorist attack on Pakistan, of course, would like nothing better than for India to get trapped into an aggressive, and preferably, military response. For they are looking for a way to kill the peace process and shift the focus of international attention back to the Indo-Pakistan border, thereby relieving the military pressure that both the jihadi groups and the Pakistani military are facing on the Afghan side. In a pre-emptive information strike, the Director-General of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency held an off-the-record briefing on Saturday to warn of a possible Indian troop build-up. The real aim of the briefing, of course, was to threaten the redeployment of Pakistani forces from the border areas of Afghanistan — where they have suffered heavy casualties in the U.S.-led war against the Taliban and the al-Qaeda — to the Line of Control. At least one Indian news channel leapt into the fray with an “exclusive” on troop mobilisations, following which both President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime MinisterYusuf Raza Gilani phoned up U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Dr. Rice, in turn, called New Delhi, only to be told that the story had no factual basis. But Washington’s appetite for mediation in an area of the world that western wire services love to describe as a “nuclear flashpoint” was whetted enough for her to schedule an emergency visit to India. With Dr. Rice headed this way now, the Indian side is gently seeking to up the ante with Mr. Mukherjee making guarded but ambiguous statements about India being prepared to take all steps necessary to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Indian intention is obviously to get the Americans to read the riot act to GHQ in Rawalpindi, where the real decisions on matters of “deep policy” are still taken despite the restoration of civilian rule. The only problem with this strategy is that it raises domestic expectations in India of tough action if the Pakistani side fails to deliver. And given the complex balance of forces in Pakistan with the civilian government trying to assert itself vis-À-vis the military, whatever tough action India takes is likely to strengthen the hands of the military establishment. An establishment that will cite renewed tension with India as a reason for not liquidating the strategic investment it has made in jihadi groups over the past three decades. Taking on the Lashkar In the quest for a stern and fitting response, all options, including casually-bandied about military ones like ‘surgical strikes,’ flounder on a simple fact: the only force capable of defeating terrorist groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Jaish-e-Mohammed, the al-Qaeda and the Taliban which operate from Pakistani soil is the Pakistani state itself. And the Pakistani state needs to take up this task urgently if it is to avoid imploding or becoming the next target in Washington’s ongoing ‘war on terror’. Here it is essential that India provides to Pakistan and to the international community as comprehensive and compelling a dossier as it can assemble proving its contention that ‘elements in Pakistan’ were responsible for what happened in Mumbai. Thanks to the providential arrest of a terrorist in Mumbai and his subsequent interrogation, the police are asserting with a considerable degree of confidence that the LeT planned and orchestrated the attacks that took the lives of more than 180 people. Apart from the confession of Ajmal Amir Iman, Indian intelligence agencies say they have communications intercepts and satellite phone call records linking the attackers to handlers in Pakistan. By itself, the Indian charge need not discomfit the Pakistani authorities since it is clear that ‘elements in Pakistan’ have perpetrated dozens of terrorist strikes inside their own country. Whether the terrorists who attacked Mumbai belong to a group that has attacked Pakistani targets or had handlers with links to elements within the Pakistani military establishment, there is enough evidence to suggest that it is impossible for GHQ in Rawalpindi to firewall the two. The brutal murder of Daniel Pearl showed the ease with which a ‘Kashmir-inspired’ terrorist like Omar Saeed Sheikh could make the al-Qaeda’s agenda his own. And the deliberate targeting of U.S. and British citizens and Jews in the Mumbai attacks should be a further reminder to Washington of the danger of allowing groups like LeT any breathing space. Rather than threatening a ‘limited war,’ surgical strikes or a suspension of the peace process, the logic of this metastatis is the most compelling argument India can marshal in its quest for the international community to insist that the Pakistani military make a final break with jihadi groups. The war that was launched in Mumbai will only end when the Pakistani military is compelled by the world and its own people to end its war on its own society. India can help this process by finding ways to help tilt the balance of power further in the direction of the civilian government. At the very least, it should do nothing that will tilt things the other way. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-opinion\/Indiarsquos-Pakistan-problem-is-Pakistanrsquos-problem-too\/article15353821.ece"}

Gujjars of the village, situated 260 km from Jaipur, stayed away from the Dalit Adivasi Adhikar Sammelan organised on the temple premises and virtually boycotted the Dalits' entry into the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. Policemen were deployed in large numbers in the temple premises. Though the presence of a large number of civil rights activists, including Magsaysay Award winner Aruna Roy, and media persons from Jaipur gave confidence to the local Dalits to defy restrictions imposed by the Gujjars, tension in the atmosphere was palpable with a question mark raised over the stance of the Gujjars and higher castes on the issue. The insinuation that Dalits were demanding a share in the 26-bigha agricultural land of the temple and offerings made to the deity was a deliberate ploy to shift attention from assertion of rights by Dalits to enter the temple and offer prayers as equal members of the Hindu community. \"We do not want a single inch of the land or a single paisa from the offerings. Ours is a struggle for self-respect,'' said Bhanwar Meghwanshi, the young convenor of Dalit Adivasi Adhikar Abhiyan. He pointed out that Gujjar and Dalit priests had been worshipping Goddess Chawanda in the temple as a tradition, which was abruptly stopped for no reason other than hatred for Dalits. The Gujjar priest, Mewa Ram, accompanied by youngsters from his community allegedly thrashed the 80-year-old Dalit priest Hazari Balai during the Navratra festivities on October 1 and declared a ban on the entry of Dalits into the temple. The police registered an FIR after nine days following a great deal of persuasion, but have not arrested any of the 12 accused. The Dalits' zeal to get justice could not be defeated by ploys such as registration of false cases against them alleging attempts to steal the offerings and clothes draped on the idol and violating peace. The Administration then tried to evolve a compromise without giving Dalits the right to enter the sanctum sanctorum. State Rural Development Minister Kalulal Gujjar, who is an MLA from neighbouring Mandal in Bhilwara district, was the target of attack at the public meeting attended by about 2,000 Dalits after entry into the temple. Mr. Gujjar brought members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's Scheduled Caste Morcha from other villages to Sulia on November 26 and \"staged a drama'' of taking them inside the temple. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-otherstates\/dalits-enter-temple-amid-tension\/article3033476.ece"}

He was part of a team of students of the Institute of Archaeology of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), New Delhi, on a study tour. Later in the day, vans transporting the students to the Tiruchi airport from Thanjavur were pelted with stones resulting in damage to windshields. However, the students escaped unhurt. In Thanjavur, the students and staff, 19 in total, were going around the Sri Brahadeeswara Temple when a group owing allegiance to the Naam Tamizhar Katchi and Thamizh Desiya Podhuvudamai Katchi attacked Ven. Gnanaloka Thero, who stood out in the group in his saffron robe. The students were taken to the ASI office near the temple, but the assailants surrounded the office and demanded that the monk be sent out. The incident sent shock waves among devotees and archakas who were witness to the attack. Gnanaloka Thero was asked to change his clothes and sent to Tiruchi along with other students with police escort in vans. As the vehicles entered Tiruchi, two cabs transporting the students were targeted near Ariyamangalam and G Corner, where members of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Naam Tamizhar Katchi attacked the vehicles with sticks and stones, police said. The front windshield of one of the vans and the rear one in the other were damaged. However, the students were escorted safely to the airport. City Commissioner of Police Shailesh Kumar Yadav met the students upon their arrival at the airport. The monk was put on a Chennai-bound flight later in the evening, while the others were accommodated at the airport temporarily. The students hailed from different countries, including Sri Lanka, China and Thailand and from the Northern states in India. All of them are studying Postgraduate Diploma in Archaeology (PGDA) in New Delhi. Their proposed visit to Darasuram and Gangaikondacholapuram were cancelled following the incident Gnanaloka Thero has been staying in New Delhi for the last one-and-half years pursuing the diploma course. The 46-year-old monk, who hails from Colombo, told The Hindu over phone from the Tiruchi airport that he came to India in 2011 and enrolled himself for the ASI course. He was working with the Archaeological Department in Sri Lanka before coming to India to pursue the course. “We arrived in Thanjavur by train on Saturday morning and were taken on a field visit to Big Temple when the assault took place at around 9.30 a.m. Soon after, we were all put in two vehicles immediately and sent to Tiruchi,” he said. Eleven persons, including A.Nalladurai, State coordinator of Naam Thamizhar Katchi and Pazha.Rajendran of the Thamizh Desiya Podhuvudamai Katchi, were arrested in Thanjavur, while 10 persons, including MDMK rural district secretary, Tiruchi, were held in Tiruchi in connection with the stone-throwing incident. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/sri-lankan-monk-assaulted\/article4517654.ece"}

The memorandum given to Chief Minister Harish Rawat, on Saturday, read: “The stone crushers working in the area will [be the cause of dust and health problems which will] result in migration of the population…here most of the people are completely dependent on the earnings from the agricultural produce [and the dust from the stone crushers would destroy agriculture].” Environmentalist Anil Prakash Joshi, founder of the Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organisation (HESCO), was present during the protest. He said, “The Maletha village is known for its agricultural produce. The area used to be barren, but, by the efforts of one Madho Singh Bhandari in the 16th century, agricultural was revived here. The government is planning to destroy the place which has immense historic importance.” “By allowing mining in the region, and with the stone crushers ruining the fragile mountains, the area is on its way to destruction,” Dr. Joshi said. The memorandum states that some villagers were completely dependent on the earnings from the agricultural produce. But, the mining would destroy the irrigated land. Dr Joshi said, “The protest was to make the government realise the hazards of allowing stone crushers to function in an agriculturally rich area. Not only will the dust from the crushers destroy the fertile land, it might also cause health problems in the locals.” In the memorandum the villagers have requested the State government to cancel the licence of the five stone crushers that are functioning in the area. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-otherstates\/mining-will-hit-agriculturallyrich-tehri-region-say-villagers\/article6345907.ece"}

Led by A Sagayamadha, an office-bearer of the All India Farm Workers Association, the villagers, including a large number of women from the panchayat comprising six villages, staged the protest urging the district administration to immediately disconnect the illegal water connections and ensure uninterrupted water supply to them. Sagayamatha said the main pipeline passed through Sengudi panchayat and those who enjoyed influence with local officials, got illegal house connections, depriving water supply to the more than 5,000 people living in Varavani panchayat. As those in Sengudi panchayat and other places tapped the water and stored them in huge water tanks, others were deprived of their due share of drinking water, she said. “We have been facing the problem for the past two years,” she said. When the district administration made serious efforts to provide water supply to all hamlets in the district, officials at the panchayat level ‘colluded’ with the locals and indulged in the illegal acts. Even after the officials disconnected the illegal water connections, they got them reconnected after influencing the local officials, she alleged. A Chelladurai, Assistant Director, Panchayats, held talks with the representatives of the protesters and assured them that the issue would be resolved. In a brief chat with reporters, he said he had ordered the immediate disconnection of the illegal house connections.

Ms. Rajakumari went to the village as part of a team appointed by the TDP to inquire into alleged irregularities in payment of wages to workers under National Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme (NRLEGP). Other members of the team were two MLAs - Hemalata (Satyavedu) and Lalitakumar (S Kota) and two MLCs – Y.B. Rajendra Prasad and Siddha Raghava Rao. Even as the team members were examining the job cards at the panchayat office, Congress workers mobbed them and picked up a row with Ms. Rajakumari and hauled her up for making ‘derogatory remarks’ against the Daggubati couple some time ago. The wordy duel soon turned violent with Congress workers pushing and pulling Ms. Rajakumari. Some others pelted stones in which Ms. Rajakumari’s gunman sustained bleeding injury on his head. In the melee, Ms. Rajakumari lost her consciousness. The TDP leaders were aghast over the developments. Satyavedu MLA Hemalata made good her escape. When they regained their wits, they took Ms. Rajakumari in a car to Chirala for medical help. ‘Attack motivated’ Speaking to The Hindu over telephone from her hospital bed, Ms. Rajakumari said it was a clear attempt on her life. She held the Daggubati couple responsible for the ugly incidents. Saying that the attack was planned and motivated, she demanded Dr. Venkateswara Rao to resign his Assembly membership and sought an apology from Ms. Purandeswari. She also asked the Congress to take action against Dr. Venkateswara Rao and put an end to his “murderous” politics. TDP district president Karanam Balaramakrishna Murthi, who went to the village along with the team, blamed the police for remaining mute spectators to the one-hour ‘sordid drama. ’ He said 250 persons, some of them in a drunken state, went to the panchayat office only to disturb their inquiry. As the TDP candidate got 450 votes majority in Karamchedu village in the recent Assembly elections, ‘Waiting for a chance’ Dr. Venkateswara Rao was waiting for an opportunity to settle scores with his political adversaries. The NRLEGP controversy brewing over the last fortnight came in handy for him, Mr. Murthi said. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-andhrapradesh\/Nannapaneni-injured-in-lsquoattackrsquo\/article16555114.ece"}

The employees also served an ultimatum to the government that unless they shelved the decision on privatisation, they would go ahead with their indefinite strike plan and intensify their ongoing agitation.

The employees and officers of DCI, who are seething with anger ever since the Union Cabinet approved the proposal for privatisation of the company last month, formed Save DCI Forum to spearhead a peaceful agitation. The employees paid tributes to the photograph of Venkatesh at the DCI corporate office and protest camp at Three Horse Junction, where their relay hunger strike entered the eighth day on Tuesday. The employees, who already served an indefinite strike notice on or before December 6, will finalise the date of launching the cease-work agitation shortly. “Ours is a profit-making company ever since it was set up in 1976.

Sethi, Joint General Manager “DCI is the pride of Andhra Pradesh as its corporate office was set up in Visakhapatnam instead of Mumbai.

They were led by the District Collector and the District Revenue Officer (DRO). The temple entry followed an agreement reached at peace talks on Monday between Dalits and caste Hindus. Arrangements were made for Dalits to offer special prayers early in the day. As the police and district administration officials waited outside the temple for their arrival, about 75 Dalits from Therkku Kaadu Dalit habitations were taken to the temple in vans escorted by police personnel. Women and men jostled with one another as they crossed the threshold of the temple and walked towards the sanctum sanctorum with flowers, garlands and coconuts as offerings to the idol. As they craned their necks to catch a glimpse of the deity, the DRO and the Collector personally collected their offerings and passed them on to the priest in the sanctum sanctorum for special prayers. While community leaders, including Chettipulam panchayat president and vice-chairman of Vedaranyam Panchayat Union, waited at the entrance to felicitate officials including the Collector and DRO, officials stepped aside to personally usher in the Dalits into the temple. Collector C. Munianathan and DRO A. Annadurai personally served prasadam to every Dalit inside the temple after the prayers. Later, Mr. Munianathan expressed his unequivocal displeasure to the panchayat president and vice-chairman over the turn of affairs over the past fortnight. “Discrimination has no place,” he said. He appealed to Dalits to function normally without any fear and assured them of all administrative support. Police personnel would be stationed in the area for a few more days to ensure normalcy.

Yousuf Staff Reporter Forced to look for alternative transport due to cab operators’ strike; autorickshaws too join stir today HYDERABAD: It was an altogether different day for employees working in the IT and BPO companies on Thursday. Used as they were to travelling in air-conditioned vehicles with pick-ups and drops at their doorsteps, they were forced to look for alternative transport due to the cab operators’ strike from Wednesday midnight. For a change, most of them had to jostle like other office-goers commuting in packed RTC buses and local trains, while some brought out their personal vehicles on the roads with an estimated 30,000 taxis and other vehicles, all with yellow registration plates, going off the road. Contentious issue The Greater Hyderabad Cab and Bus Operators Association went on strike demanding exemption from payment of Value Added Tax (VAT) with retrospective effect from 2003. Its contention was that the cabs and buses only provide a “service” and hence, VAT cannot be applied. Passengers to the Shamshabad airport did not have much of a problem as some radio cab operators did not participate in the strike and they made brisk business. “We don’t pay VAT as we operate vehicles with meters,” said Meru Cabs Senior Manager (operations) Joseph Gattu. The usually clogged Madhapur junction saw a free vehicular flow since midnight. But, employees who logged out of their night shifts on Thursday morning had a torrid time reaching their destinations as they had to either hop onto buses or autos if a kind friend or relative did not come for a pick-up. ‘Harrowing experience’ “I went to my office in Madhapur by boarding an overcrowded RTC bus at Secunderabad. It was a harrowing experience,” said R. Premnath, a call centre staffer and resident of Regimental Bazaar, echoing the commuting travails being faced by scores of such employees. Mild tension There was mild tension near Hi-Tec City on Wednesday night when some cab drivers tried to prevent their fellow drivers from ferrying employees to their residences. The police intervened and dispersed them. Irate cab drivers also damaged three vehicles at Tarnaka, Habsiguda, Chandrayangutta and Shamshabad airport early on Thursday for ferrying passengers. “We will continue our strike till we get an assurance from the Government. The strike has hit those in the IT and ITES sectors hard,” said association president N. K. Sultania. ‘No other option’ Meanwhile, the Twin Cities Auto Rickshaw Owners Welfare Association has unanimously decided to go on an indefinite strike from Thursday midnight demanding immediate increase in the existing auto fares. “We have no other option except to go on strike as auto drivers were facing untold problems due to steep rise in fuel prices,” said association president Mirza Rafatullah Baig. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-andhrapradesh\/Unusual-day-for-IT-call-centre-employees\/article15236618.ece"}

Mr. Azeem told them that the issue would be brought to the notice of district Collector M. Buddha Prakash Jyothi, who is also the Special Officer for the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation. The matter would be escalated to Principal Secretary and the Municipal Administration Minister, he said. Mr. Azeem said everyone is aware that the contractors were on agitation mode. A fellow in their community breathed his last. The image of the corporation would be at stake if everyone goes on strike or protest, he said, adding, “I am caught between the devil and the deep sea.” The issues raised by both of you (contractors and employees) are genuine. As a commissioner both issues have to be sorted out, he said, adding, “You know that I assumed the office when finances were red. I don’t have a magic wand to do wonders. I need some breathing space to set the things right. Till then, cooperate.” ‘Assurance needed’ The JAC convener Eswar, however, said that they cannot suspend their work to rule unless there was a categorical assurance on the salaries. “The JAC has decided to go on work to rule in any given month if the salaries were not paid on first day of that month. The members will not keep quiet if the protest was withdrawn without any assurance. There are two festivals -- one in this month, and another in next month. Consider the plight of the employees as well,” he said. The JAC leader said that they were not against the payments to the contractors. The employees’ pension contribution, Provident Fund (PF) and Gundala layout development fund were diverted to meet the contractors pending bills.

The unit is stuttering since the last few months and the workers had launched an agitation to draw the attention of the government to their predicament and this stir had lasted a few months. A series of meetings between the management and the government representatives resulted in an agreement being signed as per which the workers were to receive their pending wages, besides resumption of production at the unit. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-karnataka\/tension-prevails-as-falcon-tyres-employees-block-krs-road\/article8307608.ece"}

Leaders of non-government organisations and farmers' organisations of Madhya Pradesh would attend the mahapanchayat, he said.\n\nSeveral NGO leaders, along with former commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Brahma Dev Sharma, who now heads the Bharat Jan Andolan, were present at the press conference.\n\nDr Suneelam vehemently denied that he had ever blamed the BJP for provoking the police on January 12 as claimed in his public statements and speeches by Chief Minister DigvijaySingh. He said he was arrested by the police on January 12 itself and had been released from jail only on March 27. In all, 56 cases of murder, attempt to murder, dacoity, robbery and arson had been slapped against him. He said the Chief Minister had announced that the role of the non-official persons in the agitation and the subsequent police firing would be inquired into by the CBI. But Janata Dal leader Surendra Mohan had been informed by Union Home Secretary B P Singh in writing on March 29 that no request for a CBI inquiry into the Multai incident had been received from the Madhya Pradesh Government. He claimed that police atrocities on farmers of the region were still continuing. Kisan Sangharsh Samiti spokesman Anirudh Mishra, after he was granted bail by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in all cases against him, was booked under Section 151 CrPC and not allowed to leave the Bhopal jail. Dr Suneelam regretted the attitude of both the state government and the BJP as reflected during a discussion on theMultai police firing in the state assembly. While the state government had not fulfilled its promises about relief and compensation to the victims of the police firing, leader of the opposition and BJP leader Vikram Verma demanded Dr Suneelam's arrest under the National Security Act.\n\nMeanwhile, Suneelam again claimed that the farmers' agitation was completely peaceful and had provided no provocation to the police to open fire on them. He demanded a CBI inquiry into the whole incident and also suggested that the judicial inquiry should be conducted by a Supreme Court judge. He said the terms of reference of the judicial inquiry ordered by the state government were \"too narrow\". url : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/Storyold\/26883\/"}

The victims were passing through the market when they were stopped, beaten up and then stoned to death, said the police. The toll since Sunday morning in Ahmedabad alone is now nine.\n\nTrouble was also reported from Mirzapur in the city, when a mob gathered near a mosque threw two crude bombs at the police. Indefinite curfew continued in Danilimda and Shahpur, where several incidents of arson had been reported on Sunday. ENS\n\nBased on my interactions and observations during my visit abroad (Singapore and Cambodia) and before leaving for Goa (for the national executive) I had made up my mind that a change in the situation was required, he said.\n\nHowever, he added: It was my own assessment that removal of Modi would not help and the Opposition should trust him.\n\nIn retrospect, he said, we feel that it was a right decision. He also asked the Opposition to suggest ways other than Modis removal to help bring Gujarat back to normalcy.\n\nVajpayee said that the government had supported the Opposition motionseeking Central intervention in the state under Article 355out of a genuine seriousness and not because of any compulsions.\n\nCongratulating House Vice-chairman Krishan Kant, he said: Passing the resolution in one voice demonstrated a spirit of adjustment, reconcilation and resilience. And that he hoped that the country got this message of unanimity.\n\nRuling out immediate prospects of Assembly elections in the state, Vajpayee dismissed the criticism over his remarks on Gujarat. He said that in Gwalior, he was asked whether a notice would be issued to the Gujarat government under Article 355. I said the debate is on in Parliament and in effect, this itself is a notice to the Gujarat government, he said.\n\nIn Goa, he said, he had not decried I slam or Muslims but had only talked in context of growing global worries about rise of extremism in some countries. Vajpayee said he had disapproved of militant Hinduism at a book release function in New Delhi adding that he accepted the Hindutva of Swami Vivekananda, not the type of militant Hindutva that was being propagated now.\n\nGujarat was a blot on our fair name and no amount of explantions can wash it off, he said.\n\nThough mildly, Vajpayee blamed the Opposition for raising bogeys of communalism and rising trend of fascism as they wanted to grab power.\n\nCongress leader Arjun Singh however reiterated that the opposition would cooperate with Vajpayee on Gujarat only if he sacked Modi. Manmohan Singh also dismissed Vajpayees assertions and said Gujarat was continuing to reel under violence and communal hatred.\n\nEarlier, there was a ruckus for 20 minutes following an argument between Law Minister Arun Jaitley and Congress members over a report in The Indian Express on Sunday that contradicted the Ministers claims regarding arrests and police firing.\n\nThe problem arose when senior Congress leader Arjun Singh referred to the report and Jaitley rose to give a personal explaination.\n\nBut Congress MPs tried to prevent the Minister from doing so.\n\nChairman Krishna Kant allowed Jaitley to make a brief intervention in which he said that he stood by the figures of arrests, killings and registration of rape incidents by the police which he had earlier furnished to the House.\n\nHe gave details of two cases of rape registered by the government and said a large number of people arrested under preventive clauses had been freed by the courts leading to the possible decline in the number of apprehended people. url : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/oldStory\/2233\/"}

They were demanding the repeal of a recent State Government order on colleges.\n\nFor the BJP minister, the action came from unexpected quarters because the ABVP, like the party, is an arm of the Sangh Parivar. The activists virtually held the Minister in their custody for over twenty minutes on the dais, chanting slogans against the State's controversial decision to grant permission to new Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) colleges run by some politicians and influential education barons.\n\nWhat came as a surprise was that no police bandobast had been done despite the fact that the ABVP had earlier announced in the media its plan of action.The incident occurred when Rane began to read out his speech at the inauguration of the third convention of Maharashtra-Goa section of Indian Society for Technical Education beingheld at Cusrow Wadia Institute of Technology.\n\nIn what seem a well-orchestrated plan, ABVP activists rushed to the stage, pushed the Minister aside and grabbed. As the personal bodyguard of Rane, a police officer and two police constables, watched helplessly, the activists raised slogans and called for immediate cancellation of the inauguration ceremony.\n\nWhen things appeared to go out of hand, the police was summoned. But the frenzied group refused to calm down and demanded that the minister make an immediate announcement about cancelling permission to the BCS colleges run by former State Minister Shashikant Sutar, MLA Ramakrishna More and former Senate member N C Joshi.\n\nAs the events unfolded on the dais, the invitees -- those present included Director of Forbes Marshall Farhad Forbes, Dr N R Shetty, president ISTE, State technical education director P K Patil -- and organisers, senior office-bearers of ISTE found themselves in a tangle.\n\n\"The decision to grant permission for new BCS colleges wastaken by the Cabinet. I am ready to discuss the issue later provided the activists allow the inauguration ceremony to continue,'' Rane pleaded.\n\nBut the activists, who numbered close to a hundred, would have none of it. They eventually forced Rane to enter into an on-the-spot dialogue with their representatives.\n\nAs pandemonium reigned, a police team escorted Rane to the Principal's room where the Minister held discussions with the ABVP office-bearers. After fifteen minutes, Rane returned to the dais and announced that if the permission for the BCS courses had been granted by flouting rules and regulations, it would be cancelled.\n\nRane did, however, buy himself some breathing time, saying it will take seven days to decide on the issue.\n\n\"It will take at least seven to eight days to deliberate on the issue from the point of view of students, who have been enrolled for the BCS course in these colleges, and serving notices to colleges,'' he said. url : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/Storyold\/60168\/"}

For around two hours in the morning the residents did not allow trucks of the Municipal Corporation to dump refuse at the ground.\n\nRaising slogans against the civic body, the protesters, led by area councillor Kamlesh, demanded that the waste be taken to the garbage processing plant that has been set up to process the refuse. The trucks were not allowed to move till the Municipal Commissioner Prerna Puri reached the site. Additional Commissioner, Sunil Bhatia and Medical Officer of Health Dr B K Salwan also reached the spot to pacify the agitators.\n\nRubbish piling up at the dumping ground has been plaguing the residents of Dadumajra for the past many years.

Recently, the officials of the sanitation wing had raised concerns over the dumping ground developing a slope towards the residential colony.\n\nArea councillor Kamlesh said that the processing plant was not accepting the garbage. \"The plant has been set up for the purpose of processing garbage.

Of the garbage that is accepted, the rejects are so high that these are resulting in filling up of the dumping ground,\" she said.\n\nAround 311 metric tonnes of garbage is generated in the city every day. Of this, 240 metric tonnes is sent for processing to the plant. Around 147 metric tonne garbage is dumped at the ground everyday. The hunt for a new dumping ground is going on.

Malhotra, Tue Aug 26 2008, 00:30 hrs Almost two decades ago, I stood with some friends at Delhi University, discussing plans for the day: which classes to bunk and which, if any, to attend. Suddenly, a motley group of slogan-shouting students emerged from the dhaba. They exhorted us to join the protest against the recommendations of the Mandal Commission, which had been implemented a day earlier. Although none of us was clear about the issue or its repercussions, the prospect of bunking classes was reason enough. Thus we too joined the sloganeering. By the time the self-styled leaders had commandeered a few DTC buses, nearly 200 postgraduate and doctoral students had gathered at an intersection, which later became the epicentre of protests and was rechristened euphemistically as Kranti Chowk.\n\nStudents from various medical colleges of Delhi were already there, even as buses from the North Campus reached India Gate. The leaders goaded the \"revolutionaries\" to move towards Parliament, where the monsoon session was in progress. But we encountered police barricades much before that. Some hotheads tried to gatecrash, provoking the policemen into action  they charged ferociously, dispersing the crowd within minutes. We were at the rear, and managed to escape the dragnet by jumping into the shallow canals around. A few students were bundled into waiting police vans and taken to the Parliament Street police station, where they were detained for some time before being let off.\n\nThat night, Doordarshan telecast news of protests. My sister-in-law looked at me suspiciously, knowing my proclivity to land in trouble. But the matter didn't go beyond the glance that day. As old-timers will recall, this was only a curtain-raiser: an unprecedented frenzy of student anger was to engulf Delhi for several months.

Alleging medical negligence on the part of the attending surgeon, Dr D V Bhagat, a mob of around 500 people, comprising mostly BJP workers, had resorted to stone-throwing and destruction of both the civic hospital as well as Dr Bhagat's private clinic located a kilometer away from the hospital.\n\nThe Indian Medical Association has, while condemning the incident, decided that a more trenchant protest needs to be made against the increasing attacks on the medical community. They have demanded an apology from the BJP and compensation for their colleague. Dr Bhagat has been given police protection and is at an undisclosed location. Doctors gathered at the IMA's Bombay Western Suburbs office at Vile Parle today recounted incidents of what they perceived to be a spate of attacks on the medical fraternity. Dr Arshad Ghulam Mohammad, vice president of the IMA, Bombay West branch, cited an earlier incident of the Ghatkopar nursing home kidnapping where the owner of the nursing home was arrested on charges of abetment of crime. Similarly, in another case at Goregaon, he alleged, the police had seized the surgical instruments of another doctor claiming the \"weapons'' used in the operation that resulted in the death had to be \"confiscated.''\n\nTuesday's meeting, also highlighted the ambiguity surrounding the role of senior BJP leaders from Borivli in the rioting. While some doctors claimed that the city's deputy mayor, BJP councillor Gopal Shetty, who was present at the hospital with Mishra, had almost saved the life of Dr Bhagat by escorting him to the police van, Dr Paralkar, who put in his papers at Bhagwati today, quoted hospital staff saying that Shetty was in fact inciting the mob. \"Two truckloads of police stood by and watched as the mob rushed towards the private clinic of Dr Bhagat,'' said Paralkar adding that municipal hospitals were no longer safe places to work in.\n\nFighting against naming any particular party, speakers criticised goondaism. Dr Prabhakar Rao, president of the Association of Medical Consultants remarked sarcastically that today, it was politicians who dispensed `instant justice'. \"We don't need consumer courts and police inquiries, or the coroner's court to tell us who is responsible for a death. Today we have people who can immediately tell you that it was the doctor's mistake,'' he said. He expressed wonder at the fact that a mob of 500 people had gathered at the `unearthly' hour of 6 am on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, a one-man inquiry team has been set up to look into the matter. Its report is expected to be in within three days. The IMA has demanded that an independent inquiry be held into the mob behaviour and the guilty be punished according to law.\n\nTwo men, two families, two stories, yet linked by a common incident - the violent death of former chief of BJP's Borivli unit, Om Prakash Mishra. A day after Mishra, succumbed to his wounds suffered of an assassin's bullet at Bhagwati Hospital, under Dr D V Bhagat's care, the latter continues to remain under police protection away from home. In fact, as adviced by the police, he is nowhere in the immediate vicinity of Borivli. And even as his family nervously awaits his return home, the grieving family of Mishra want him booked and punished.\n\nDr Bhagat's family's only contact with him is through his mobile phone. His wife Jyotsna told Express Newsline: \"My husband has never said no to any operations...his very life is his patients. Even on Tuesday (the day Mishra was gunned down), he had rushed to Bhagwati in the middle of the night to perform an operation at 3 am. Why is he being singled out.''\n\nDr Bhagat's nursing home is shut, his patients have been transferred to another nursing home nearby. The shreds of glass are still littered about in the nursing home as a lone police constable sits there on duty. Dr Bhagat when contacted said he was in the operation theatre (OT) when the patient was brought in. \"I immediately asked him to be brought to the OT...but we realised he was in peripheral shock with low BP. I asked for blood to be arranged, for without blood I could not operate as I suspected him to have intra abdominal haemorrage,'' he said and added he just went home to freshen up as organising blood takes at least half an hour. When he came back the patient had died.\n\nBut Mishra's family and neighbours claim he could have been saved if only \"the doctor had given him a little time.'' Mishra's brother-in-law refused to entertain any questions saying his world was shattered. The slain BJP leader's neighbours too blame Dr Bhagat for Mishra's death. For them Mishra was like a member of family and they can't get over his loss. \"Don't say he was a nice man, he is a nice man...he will continue to be with us,'' the neighbours said.\n\nMeanwhile, the post-mortem report, which is yet to reach Bhagwati, has revealed that the bullet had punctured all vital organs in the victim's body. It was learnt that 15 fragmants of bullets were removed during the PM. url : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/Storyold\/48615\/"}

The protest, which caught the district police and civil administration unawares, began before 9 am and was continuing till the time of filing of this report.\n\nAfter all efforts made by district officials failed to pacify the protesters, District Planning Committee Chairman N K Sharma managed to take along some protesters for a meeting with Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal in Chandigarh.\n\nThough the chief minister offered that the services of those who fulfill the requisite qualification will be regularised, the protesters refused to budge and remained adamant on their demand of regularising the services of all 1,380 staffers, who were retrenched after five years of service at rural veterinary hospitals and dispensaries under the Zila Parishads across the state.\n\nAround 10.45 am, 10 protesters came down from the building after N K Sharma reassured them of accepting their demand. Till the filing of this report, all protesters were squatting outside Vikas Bhawan and said would call off their stir only after getting formal orders regarding regularisation of all retrenched staffers.\n\nurl : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/news\/after-success-of-teachers-pharmacists-repea\/767067\/"}

Despite the assurance by School Education Minister Sudhir Joshi regarding timely declaration of results of HSC and Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination, Vani claims their association has yet to be approached by the State Government.\n\nWhile the examining work is nearly over, minor details are being processed with a meeting of the examination committee scheduled soon to decide on the date of declaring the HSC results. While the staff employees sported black badges from May 15-17, they are now poised to stage a work-to-rule agitation from May 23 and the entire lot will take mass casual leave on May 25 to highlight their demands.\n\nWhile time-bound promotions is their major demand, the employees have also lamented that despite the State Government resolution to appoint one junior clerk for every 3,000 students (for examination purposes) the board has not done so. In fact, with the increasing number of students it was unfair to appoint only one junior clerk, Mukund Pote, secretary of the Karmachari Sanghatana said.\n\nDemanding implementation of the GR issued in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in R K Sabharwal Vs Punjab Government, they have urged that peons should not be transferred. What has aggravated matters is that a circular issued by the board on May 14 said there were more than the required number of peons in the board and directed them to sign an undertaking expressing their willingness to be transferred to any of the remaining divisional boards of Aurangabad, Amravati, Nashik, Latur and Kolhapur. Refusing to sign the undertaking, several Class IV employees claimed there was a need for more such appointments instead of reducing their strength.\n\nCoinciding with the unrest in the board is the indefinite hunger strike launched by three employees Mahesh Ahire, Shriram Gavai and Balkrishna Gadekar whose regular promotions were denied and the former two were transferred to Nashik on the same post.\n\nWhile the employees had time and again submitted demands to Vijay Patil, chairman of State Board, the federation's office bearers claimed he did not take any decision. url : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/Storyold\/33523\/"}

This means that for the time being, the bonus of 8.33 per cent of the pay added to ex gratia of Rs 2500, declared by the BEST management stands accepted.\n\nA copy of the agreement was quickly drafted after which the union leaders rushed to BEST Bhavan to obtain the General Manager's signature.\n\nThe strike was called off after the CM personally intervened to hold an hour-long meeting with Mayor Nandu Satam, BEST Chairman Arvind Nerkar, Rao and other union leaders earlier in the day.\n\nAt the end of the day the unions even got a pat on their back for their efforts. The chief minister expressed satisfaction at their understanding and said that such agitations would not happen in future.\n\nThe BEST management, which had threatened `strict action' against employees, has meekly agreed not to prosecute them.

Their jaw dropped in horror when a fireman in a retardant suit rescued a woman from a burning thatched hut and placed her in the ambulance. The event was part of an awareness programme on fire safety held on Saturday for the students of Chennai Schools in the locality. The programme was organised by the Burns Association of India, RLT Foundations, Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services, GVK EMRI 108 and Railway Protection Force. The students learnt a valuable lesson on safety as the firemen explained the various kinds of fire, their causes and the material used to extinguish them and repeated the emergency phone numbers after every demonstration. The firemen allowed the students to light fireworks and explained the correct method of treating injuries. “Pour water on the burnt area to cool the flesh. This will prevent the heat from spreading to the deeper tissues,” a fireman explained. Winners of a spot quiz received prizes from TNFRS director Bhola Nath. Earlier in the day, Mr. Nath flagged off a rally at Purasawalkam in which 300 students participated. Lighting fireworks under adult supervision would prevent accidents, they said. Doctors, who participated in the programme at the school, emphasised the need to follow the first aid rules. Burns Association of India president K. Mathangi Ramakrishnan and vice-president V.Jayaraman cited examples to highlight the trauma fire accident victims undergo. They said children injure themselves when they light firecrackers while holding them in their hands. Sometimes, the injury is so severe that the hand is severed, Dr. Mathangi said. Most injuries occur on the face as the crackers are handled close to the face or when children get too close to the bonfire of leftover crackers, Dr. Jayaraman said. Synthetic and loose-fitting garments are another reason for fire accidents during Deepavali, the doctors said. In a release, ophthalmologist Mohan Rajan of Rajan Eye Care Hospital said last year of 24 patients treated for firecracker injuries, 16 were children in the 6 to 15 age group. In case of injury the patient must be rushed within an hour to the eye hospital. “Like any other medical emergency, eye injuries must be treated immediately after the injury,” he said. Major injuries include traumatic cataract, corneal tear, retinal detachment, vitreous haemorrhage and rupture globe, he added. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-tamilnadu\/message-on-fire-safety-for-students\/article2564040.ece"}

And these bars witnessed a heavy rush, as people flocked in groups to enjoy their drinks for the last time in these watering holes. Majority of them are of the view that the closure would only lead to the spread of illicit and spurious liquor across the State. They were also quick to recall the few hooch tragedies that took place years before. Alongside the protests, there were also celebrations in different parts of the city to hail the decision. Most of these celebrations were organised under the aegis of the Congress and its feeder organisations. According to the district unit of the Kerala Bar Owners Association, as many as 71 bars across the district will be closed down once the order is implemented. “We are not sure about the timing of the closure and are yet to get a direction from the excise department,” said Jose Pradeep, president, Ernakulam district unit of the organisation. Meanwhile, the verdict has left the fate of thousands of bar workers hanging in the balance. They had feared for their future when 400-odd bars were closed down on quality issues and were dealt another blow when the State government declared a liquor policy with prohibition at the core. “We were pinning our hopes on a favourable verdict from the High Court which has now been belied. Everyone is talking about the impact of the decision on the tourism industry, but what about our future. The government made the lofty promise of rehabilitation package but had fallen silent since then. Are we supposed to remain jobless leaving our families in hunger till the government comes out with a package,” lamented Vijay M.G, a bartender in the city.

Photo : A. Muralitharan Staff Reporter Being built as part of underground drainage network scheme TAMBARAM: Residents of Keelkattalai on Tuesday protested the construction of a lift station (a powerful pumping station) at a burial ground at Arulmurugan Nagar. The lift station is being built as part of the underground drainage network scheme currently on in Pallavaram Municipality. There are more than a dozen residential localities around the burial ground at Arulmurugan Nagar in Keelkattalai and the facility would not only shrink space of the only burial ground in the vicinity, but would also add to civic woes, the protestors said. They have urged the Pallavaram Municipality and the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, that is executing the project, to shift the site for the proposed facility to other vacant areas of Keelkattalai. Metrowater officials said the facility would not inconvenience residents and they had no other option but to build the lift station in the present location. The lift station in Keelkattalai was proposed to be built on Arulmurugan Main Road, but was dropped following protests from residents as it involved filling up of an abandoned well. In November, Labour Welfare Minister and Alandur MLA T.M. Anbarasan and Commissioner of Municipal Administration Niranjan Mardi, among others, inspected the site and decided to build the lift station on the adjacent burial ground. Following this, work commenced three days ago and on Monday, Metrowater officials deployed an earth moving equipment. Consequently, the residents staged a demonstration on Tuesday. Municipal Chairman E. Karunanidhi said the facility would consume only two cents of land and reassured residents they would not be exposed to inconvenience in any form. The Metrowater officials said they had taken all factors into consideration while preparing detailed project report and only then decided to install a lift station at Arulmurugan Nagar. It was not feasible to build this facility at any other place in Keelkattalai. The purpose of this lift station being built at an estimated cost of Rs. 35 lakh and equipped to handle up to 5 lakh litres of sewage a day was to transport sewage from low-level areas to a gravity system interceptor, before being taken to the main pumping station. url : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-tamilnadu\/Residents-up-in-arms-against-lift-project-on-burial-ground\/article14705020.ece"}

The altercation took a turn for the worse as bystanders from both the communities joined in with whatever they could lay their hands on. Brickbats flew from all directions and a few knives were also flashed.\n\nPersonnel from the local police station, which is less than half-a-kilometre from the spot, reached 20 minutes after the clashes broke out. The arrival of the police did not deter the mob, which continued with the brickbatting from the safety of their houses.\n\nPolice teargassing was answered with a few gunshots in the air from one of the houses. In retaliation, the police fired a few rounds in the air which finally capped the clashes.\n\nAn hour-and-a-half after the trouble began, the situation was completely under control. Tension was, however, still palpable in the air. Barring the men in mufti, the roads, which were littered with bricks, were completely deserted. Shop shutters had been downed. After the Chief Minister was briefed about the incident, she was mobbed by the residents and had to listen to the acute power problem in the area. There was no power in the area at the time. \"The frequent power cuts is what encourages anti-social elements in the area'', complained a resident.\n\nDikshit instructed Power Minister Narendra Nath to ensure uninterrupted power supply in the area for a few days. The residents told the CM that it was not the residents of the area who indulged in fighting. \"Anti-social elements from outside fight here often over gambling. Sometimes it assumes a communal flavour,'' they said.\n\nEven as the police were rounding up the suspects and interrogating Chanda -- the prime suspect and a known ruffian -- a stone flew and landed near the area SDM Prakash Chandra. Home guards ran in the direction from which the stone had been hurled and caught hold of a teenaged boy and dragged him in the direction of the local police station.\n\nThe number of persons injured during the clashes could not be ascertained as most of them had gone into hiding. The PCR vans standing outside GTB hospital and SDN hospital waited for the injured, but no one turned up.\n\nAfter the Chief Minister left, residents started peering out of their houses and by 7 pm many of them started venturing out. Neighbours could be seen taking stock of the situation and discussing the number of \"innocent people'' who had been detained by the police. url : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/Storyold\/74426\/"}

The four districts of Nadia, Murshidabad, Malda and Birbhum, where polling will be held on Monday, are Congress strongholds, and the shadow of widescale violence looms large as over 80 per cent of booths in this phase are either marked as 'highly sensitive' or 'sensitive'.\n\nPolice said two Congress workers  Nurmohhamad Sheikh and Ahad Ali  were killed after being hit by crude bombs late Saturday night at Kapasdanga in Murshidabad district. TMC workers have been accused of leading the attacks. There were reports of skirmishes and clashes, including stone pelting, in the area in which two policemen were injured. Another Congress worker, Repon Sheikh, was killed at Bharatpur in the same district during a clash between rival party supporters, the police said.\n\nSpeaking to a TV news channel, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee shrugged off the allegations that Trinamool cadres were behind the killing of the Congress workers. Accusing the CPM of instigating the violence, she said the deaths were result of clashes between the Congress and the Marxists.\n\nEarlier in the day, in a statement posted on Trinamool website, the Chief Minister said in the fourth and fifth phases of the elections, where the Congress \"has a presence, the party will deliberately be up to mischief\".\n\nBut Congress MP and Union minister from Murshidabad Adhir Chowdhury blamed the Trinamool for the violence. \"Trinamool is trying to create disturbances in tomorrow's elections, which is the reason why they are issuing such statements.\" He alleged that the police did act to prevent such incidents despite the party giving them inputs about the violence beforehand. \"The miscreants, who were earlier with the CPM and have recently joined the TMC, are responsible for the violence,\" Chowdhury said.\n\nurl : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/news\/3-cong-workers-killed-on-phaseiv-eve\/1144825\/"}

Singh and the Jan Morcha have been leading a vociferous agitation in the last few months against the Mulayam Singh Yadav government against the buying 2,500 acres of \"prime agricultural land\" from farmers at a \"throwaway price\" for the Dadri power project.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after he handed over the memorandum to the President, Singh said, \"In the garb of development and public purpose, the UP government has forcibly acquired vast tracts of agricultural land, that too paying minimum compensation to farmers. The SP government has used the Act on Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as the legal cover for the continued pursuit of reckless pro-rich, anti-kisan and anti-poor policies. We have petitioned the President for a national moratorium for six months on the acquisition of land under SEZs, and the constitution of a high-level commission of eminent persons for a new policy and effective mechanism to ensure the rights of the dispossessed people.\"\n\nSingh was accompanied by Jan Morcha president and suspended Samajwadi Party MP Raj Babbar, CPI's A B Bardhan, Morcha ideologue Surendra Mohan and former bureaucrat SP Shukla. Babbar was equally scathing in his attack against Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, when he deplored the state administration's high-handedness in dealing with agitating farmers. Babbar said, \"The atrocities and violence unleashed by the state police in collusion with private security agents against the poor peasants on the eve of the peaceful satyagrhaha planned last month would put to shame even a dictatorial regime. Houses were searched, women threatened, children hurt and property looted, all in the name of law and order.\"\n\nAccusing Mulayam of being the \"handmaiden of a corporate house\" Singh's litany of complaints run long: there were no competetive bids asked before Reliance acquired the land for the Dadri project; no sign of work beginning though two years have passed since the land acquisition and there is no evidence that the state government considered alternative sites.\n\nurl : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/news\/vp-takes-his-protest-to-kalam\/13047\/"}

Rajasekhara Reddy-led government and the Maoists finally lapsed, and peace hopes went for a toss at the first round of the talks itself.\n\nThe police says the Maoists put the lull to good use. The government reined us back from May 2004, to make way for the talks. Over the next seven months, the Maoist cadre strength in Telengana went up from less than 600 to 930, says an intelligence source.\n\nMaoist sources, however, rubbish that. They claim to have about 1,400 armed men now. Besides, they have managed to merge the CPI(ML), Peoples War (PW) and the MCC to pack a whole more firepower.\n\nOnce the talks foundered, the policemen were asked to get into the act, with the Greyhounds, Andhra Pradeshs anti-Naxal commando force, leading the way. Police statistics say 16 extremists died in 18 exchanges of fire in just the six weeks from 14 December 2004.\n\nThe Naxalites, of course, have a counter-theory for these exchanges:\n\n If you go by the Naxalites, Raji Reddy, squad commander of CPI-ML Jan Shakti was unarmed and talking to a decoy disguised as an aggrieved local in the Mulugu forest on January 6. The police burst into the scene and shot him. The decoy was safe.\n\n Lakshmi, a tailor in a Kurnool village, was shot in Pullelaceruvu, Prakasam, after she was found talking to some Maoists. She had never held a gun, complains a Maoist.\n\n Narasimha was CPI-ML Jan Shakti squad commander for Mustabad, Karimnagar. He had a ear infection and came out of hiding for treatment. A sympathiser offered to take him on his scooter to the village doctor.\n\nYSR SPEAK  On his perception of CPI ML (Maoists): They are our own prodigal sons. There may be differences between us, but we hope to get them across the table, and sort things out, at some point of time.  On his approach to Naxalism The Naxalite problem crops up only where development has been heavily lopsided, and against the poor. My government has vowed to do its best to correct that over the long term. This is vital to prevent the niche for extremism (from developing).  On disarming Naxalites as a pre-condition for talks We cannot possibly have people going around with arms, for any reason. Things cannot be different in their case * The police spotted them and gave chase. Narasimha was gunned down in a telephone booth in a crowded village market, trying to make a frantic SOS call.\n\nOn January 19, the police allegedly arrested Sagar, alias Salim, a squad commander of the Maoists, his assistant Ramachandra, and a 17-year old Dalit boy called Anil, who was with them. The three were found dead near a lake in Sirsila town the next morning.\n\nThe police claimed they were killed while trying to blow up the local bus station. Protests erupted and Home Minister Jani Reddy declared there would be no more encounters.\n\nThat holiday lasted barely a week, until the killing of four more Maoists on January 28, in the Tadwai Mandal forests of Warangal. Curiously, no policeman has died in any of these exchanges of fire.\n\nIF the policemen have been ruthless, the Maoists havent lagged behind. Their tally in the corresponding six weeks is: 18 murders, four murder attempts, 21 assaults, 10 cases of arson, five of blasting buildings. Nine of their victims were workers of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) or the Congress.\n\nMaoist sources admit most of those killed died only so that the score could be evened: We need to quickly make the point.\n\nThe Maoists have used the peace well. Their numbers have grown. If recent seizures are any indication, weaponry is far removed from crude country guns or the odd rifle taken from a killed policeman. Today, sophisticated guns, stockpiles of Claymore mines and gelatine sticks are the norm.\n\nThe more types of arms they have, Swaranjit Sen, the state DGP, reasons, the more they will struggle to find different ammunition. And the more they swell their ranks, the more they will have less-motivated and less-trained cadre, who could be a big liability.\n\nANOTHER senior police officer is less optimistic. He sees a deadly enemy: They now have the best assault rifles and imported revolvers, even satellite phones. Their land mines are getting more sophisticated. It is no longer the famished, crudely-armed desperado we are looking at.\n\nAn intelligence source says the killing of seven policemen in Karnatakas Pavagada  the Kudremukh forest region in the state is Naxalite country  was courtesy a party from Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIt actually had less to do with retaliating for the killing of the Maoists Karnataka state secretary Saket Rajan, says the official, than with arms. They carted off a dozen assault rifles.\n\nFOR Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, going through the motions of the talks was inescapable, even if he himself hadnt given it much of a chance. It was an election promise in 2004, while taking on N. Chandrababu Naidus TDP in the assembly election.\n\nNaidu, in nine years as chief minister, had refused refused to talk till the Naxalites gave up arms. Ironically, Reddy now finds himself doing a Naidu.\n\nThe only proponents of the peace talks have been Home Minister Jana Reddy and some Telengana MLAs, who bear the brunt of the Naxalite problem in their constituencies. The police has been aggressively hawkish.\n\nFor good reason too. The de facto powers and profile that cops enjoy in Andhra is extraordinary, much of it is derived from their anti-Naxalite role. That is besides the huge unaudited funds ... observes K. Balagopal, senior lawyer and human rights activist, in Hyderabad.\n\nTalks are a political activity. The police cant sit on its job, waiting for things to get better, police chief Sen tells The Sunday Express.\n\nTHE Maoists insist the government is all wrong. Aside from demanding they give up weapons, it is not settling the hundreds of cases pending against PW cadre from 1992-1996, when the group was banned.\n\nThe government agreed to drop those cases, but did nothing, says Varavara Rao, poet and official spokesman for the Maoists. He is also angry at the governments refusal to distribute to the landless some 12 million acres of disused land the PW has apparently identified.\n\nBalagopal was a member of the government committee to monitor violations of peace talks conditions. He resigned in protest against the police killings and now says, Its the end of the road. \n\nA senior police officer admits to be worried about the Maoists penetrating human rights groups or sponsoring new ones. He points to the January 2 arrest of a senior member of the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee (APCLC). The man was part of a team trying to get a consignment of arms and ammunition, hidden in their car, to the Maoists.\n\nVaravara Rao, however, sees this as just another police attempt to scare off Maoist sympathisers. At least four APCLC activists have died mysterious deaths in recent times, and the Maoists, of course, blame the police, promise revenge. url : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/oldStory\/65014\/"}

The inmates demanded that the officers who were the first ones to treat them as human beings should not be transferred. Finally the government agreed to reconsider the order. But the department struck back. Narayan Singh, who was a superintendent at the home for two months before being transferred to the nearby Training and Production Centre two months ago, received his suspension order today. Singh said Joseph and Prasad, the two officials whose transfers are being reconsidered, used to visit him frequently in his office, which is a stone's throw away from the Home for Leprosy Patients.\n\n\"This has led the department to conclude that I prompted the idea of an agitation among the inmates after the two officials were transferred,'' he said. Singh said that he was also asked to meet Chief Secretary Omesh Saigal and Secretary (Social Welfare) Narendra Prasad to explain his side of the story. \"What could I say? How can I be responsible for the actions of other people?'' he said.\n\nWhen contacted by Express Newsline, Saigal confirmed the order and promised to look into the matter. Director of the Department of Social Welfare Geeta Sagar said Narayan Singh has refused to accept the suspension order and has sent it back. \"Now I have sent it by registered post,'' she said. According to Singh, his suspension and the hunger strike were the result of an argument between Prasad and S.C. Tyagi, a deputy director at the Department of Social Welfare.\n\n\"When Tyagi came to hand over the transfer orders to the two officials, he and Prasad got into an argument over an incident which had taken place at the headquarters some time ago,'' he said. Singh said he tried to intervene and hearing the noise, the inmates gathered. He said he stopped the furious inmates from attacking Tyagi. Sagar denied that there was a fight between Tyagi and Prasad and added that the leprosy patients assaulted him when he went there to deliver the transfer orders. Tyagi was not available for comment.\n\nSagar said that there were allegations of corruption against the transferred officials of the leprosy home. Narayan Singh too was transferred from the Home on similar grounds. url : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/Storyold\/78720\/"}

But the caste violence that wrecked the lives of over a thousand Dalits earlier this month has forever tainted the image of Dharmapuri district as a former Naxal stronghold that, even a decade ago, had no place for caste or class differences.\n\nMore than two weeks after three Dalit settlements, not far from Nayakankottai in this backward district in north-west Tamil Nadu, were attacked, the air is still thick with tension. In the town of Dharmapuri, about two dozen policemen stand guard at an agitation by the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (Liberation Panthers Party, or VCK) and its president and MP, the fervent orator Thol Thirumavalavan.\n\nPeace, however brittle, prevails at the gathering. The front of harmony that existed between the two majority castesVanniyars, a Hindu caste politically represented by S Ramadoss's Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), and Parayars, one of the Scheduled Castes whose cause the VCK purports to championnow lies shattered. Observers say the fragile accord soured over the past few years upon incitement from caste leaders. They allege that the attack, apparently triggered by an inter-caste marriage, was politically engineered.\n\nWhen N Divya, a Vanniyar from Sellankottai village, and E Ilavarasan, from the neighbouring Dalit colony of Natham, fled due to parental opposition to get married, a caste panchayat held on the morning of November 7 by leaders from both communities ruled that the girl be returned to her family. Distraught at her decision to stay with her husband, Divya's father, G Nagaraj, who worked at a cooperative bank, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself. The discovery of his body later that day is said to have provoked a 1,500-strong mob to rampage through Natham and two smaller Dalit settlements, Kondampatti and Anna Nagar, where it set ablaze over 200 houses, damaged at least 50 others, and allegedly looted valuables and cash worth lakhs of rupees.\n\nurl : http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/news\/love-and-violence-in-dharmapuri\/1035856\/"}

On the whole, the talks were unproductive and preliminary, he said.\n\nThe talks are to continue as soon as faculty members provide some clarifications required by Joshi, he said.\n\nAsked if he was apologetic about letting the strike drag on for over a week Dave said he seemed to have been extremely busy and could not be blamed. But government seemed serious about settling the issue, he said.\n\nThe Faculty Association, which held a general body meeting before the talks, resolved to discharge all patients already admitted in the hospital except those who required intensive care. All post-operative and pre-operative cases will be discharged by Wednesday after which the faculty will take out a rally to the Prime Minister's residence on the same day, Anoop Saraya spokesman of the association said.\n\nAsked if it was a kind of ultimatum to the Government, he said it should not be seen in that way. That we are continuing to treat patients in the hospital is being seen as a weakness on our side. They are not even bothering to talk to us even eight days after the strike.
